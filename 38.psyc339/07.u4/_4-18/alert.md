### Activity 4.18: EFFT and Suicidality

In order to conduct a preliminary assessment, it is extremely important to understand the signs of possible suicidal behavior. In accordance with the literature, the risk assessment should not be regarded as an absolute. Continual monitoring and assessment are essential, especially at the beginning of your career. One of the exceptions to confidentiality, if you have not yet taken SOCI 400, is when there is a risk of harm to oneself or another. Whenever you suspect that your client's life is in danger, you must report it to the appropriate authorities.

For this section on suicide, you will write a validation statement that explains why someone might commit suicide. Suicide is one of the most difficult issues to validate, since when we validate it, especially with this one, we feel as though we are encouraging the individual to carry out the action. In keeping with what we have read and what research shows, it actually gives the other the feeling that they are not alone-that someone understands and is willing to share dark places with them.

This validation statement will not be accompanied by an actual scenario. Imagine someone sitting in front of you saying, "I want to end my life," and think about why they might want to do so.
