## Topic 2: What Causes It?

The aim of this discussion is to explore some of the potential causes of mental health issues. It’s important to note that identifying a single cause of mental illness is often difficult, as multiple factors can contribute to its development. As we have previously discussed, these factors may include early adverse life experiences, such as trauma, as well as a history of abuse, whether directly experienced or witnessed. Refer back to the diagram we looked at earlier, which outlines the various contributors to the development of mental health issues. Extensive research also shows that mental health problems can be linked to chronic medical conditions like cancer or diabetes. Additionally, biological factors, chemical imbalances in the brain, and changes in brain structure due to alcohol or drug use can play significant roles. Our brains, bodies, and emotions are deeply interconnected, making it challenging to pinpoint direct causes and effects.

We will discuss some of the research behind why these mental health issues occur in this section. As we continue our study of the brain, draw upon the knowledge you have gained from your previous units. The topic of depression will be discussed first, followed by suicidality and then eating disorders.

#### Depression

While depressive disorders are often labelled as chemical imbalances, this oversimplifies their complexity. Research shows that depression isn’t simply caused by a lack or excess of certain brain chemicals. Factors like faulty mood regulation, genetic vulnerability, and stressful life events all contribute, often interacting with one another. Individuals with similar symptoms of depression may have entirely different underlying causes and respond to different treatment approaches.

#### Suicide

Suicide ideation is a very prevalent issue in our society. For those who have never experienced suicide ideation, or being close to that moment of contemplation, it can be difficult to imagine the reasoning behind why this can occur. We will explore in this next section why suicide ideation might occur and why the ideation can lead to dying by suicide. As with our previous units, we will spend time looking at the brain and what brain activity occurs when suicide ideation is present.

#### Eating Disorders

In eating disorders, the exact cause is unknown. As previously discussed, there are many possible causes of mental illness.  Psychological, environmental, and social factors may contribute to the development of eating disorders in some individuals due to their genes and relational issues.
