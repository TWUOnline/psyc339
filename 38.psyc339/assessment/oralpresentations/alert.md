# Oral Presentations

&nbsp;

### Description

Students will be separated into groups of five. Each student in the group will be assigned a topic by the professor. Students will watch their fellow group members’ presentations and provide a comment or question for each. The presentations will last for 10-15 minutes and will contain information from two research articles and one community resource related to the student’s topic. All presentations must be pre-recorded and uploaded to Moodle under your group numbers by midnight on the day of our fifth class. The professor will go over how to upload videos to Moodle during Week 2 class. Presentations must be a minimum of 10 minutes and a maximum of 15, the professor will only watch a minute past the 15 minute mark.
Each student will then be required to watch their fellow group members’ presentations before the start of Week 6 class. Each student will be required to write one comment OR one question on each presentation they view (4 presentations) to be completed in Moodle.
The Professor will assign you one of the following topics and then you will present on one therapy modality that is used or has been developed for your topic (NOT EFFT):

1. Complex Trauma
2. Addictions
3. Resiliency or Stress (you can choose)
4. Death/Dying
5. Depression or Eating Disorders (You can choose)

Make sure that you pay attention to the weight that each section of the Rubric holds and curtail your research and your time to the sections that have the most weight.

- The research about therapy modality of choice related to your assigned topic.  /9
