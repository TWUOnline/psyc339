### Activity 3.12: Complicated Grief
Please review the ICG (Inventory of Complicated Grief). It is recommended that you take the ICG for the experience; however, if you have recently suffered a loss and this activity would trigger too many emotions for you, please feel free to skip it. There is research out there to be read about complicated grief, how it develops and what treatment to use with it, however it will be too much for our unit today to go over it. I encourage you to recall, instead, your readings by H. Norman Wright on “Experiencing Grief” as he writes a little bit about complicated grief towards the end of his book.

The score is out of 76 for the ICG and a score of 25 or greater is a person at high risk for requiring clinical care.

**Recommended Resource**

Mary Frances O’Connor has done a lot of research in the field of grief, relating it to biology. If you are interested in reading some of her articles, and specifically her articles on complicated grief, I will provide her website for you to peruse. This is added reading however, and does not need to be completed for this unit.
