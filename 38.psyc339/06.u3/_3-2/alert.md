### Activity 3.2: Watch | Kubler-Ross' 5 Stages of Grief

One of the first models in this field was the 5 stages of grief, which we will cover in this section. It is important to acknowledge and learn from our past, even if not everyone uses this model.

Please watch Elisabeth Kubler Ross' Five Stages of Grief. She was a major influence on how hospice care is structured today. Prior to watching this clip, it is important to note that the model was developed for dying patients, not for those who are left behind/the mourners. It may be more appropriate to apply this model to clients who are dying rather than those who are grieving.
