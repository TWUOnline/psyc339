## Topic 1: What is Grief?

![alttext](t1overview.jpg)

When a person endures a loss, they will inevitably experience grief. At some point in our lives, we all face grief. The nature of the loss shapes an individual’s grieving experience. Loss can occur in many forms: the death of a loved one, the end of a meaningful relationship, losing a job, facing a disability, or enduring the illness of a loved one. Whether the grief stems from a loved one’s passing or a terminal diagnosis, it is a powerful, sometimes overwhelming emotion. Grief can leave a person feeling numb or disconnected from daily life. To better cope with grief at various stages, experts recommend learning about the grieving process. Understanding the underlying causes of significant emotions, such as guilt over a loss, can help in navigating them.
