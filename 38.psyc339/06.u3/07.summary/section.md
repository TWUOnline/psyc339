## Unit 3 Summary

You have been able to learn about grief and dying from both the perspective of the dying as well as the perspective of those left behind during this third unit. Upon completion of this unit, you will hopefully have a better understanding of how to begin interacting with death, the systemic view of death, dying, and the elderly, as well as the importance of confronting our own fears and hesitations concerning death before we are able to assist our clients. Being the conversation starters of death also places us in a position to be an instrument of change. Creating more of a comfort and vocabulary around death, grieving and loss on a societal level will create huge change on the systemic level. We can be a part of this movement.
