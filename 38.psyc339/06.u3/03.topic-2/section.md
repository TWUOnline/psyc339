## Topic 2: How does grief/loss and death affect us?

Grief can cause emotional or physical symptoms in a person. In the early stages of grief, almost anything that people experience is normal, such as feeling extremely overwhelmed, questioning religious or spiritual beliefs, feeling mad, feeling upset or resentful. It is possible to mourn for months or years. As time passes and as the bereaved adjust to life without a loved one, to the news of a terminal diagnosis or to the possibility of losing someone they love, pain usually becomes more manageable.

The purpose of this section is to discuss how grief/loss and death affect us. 'Being Mortal' is an outstanding book that I strongly recommend you read in its entirety to gain a clear understanding of the broader system at work and how it influences the individual's process. Additionally, we will read an article that provides three ways to explain how grief and loss affect us, both from the perspective of the dying and from the perspective of the mourner. In order to conclude this topic, we will examine the ICG scale. There will be references to Complex Grief in our readings, but we will not go into specifics due to the limited time we have together.
