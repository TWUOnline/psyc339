## Topic 2: How/Why does addiction develop?

![alttext](topic2overview.jpg "distorted light")

Among the most common causes of addiction development mentioned in the literature are chronic stress, trauma, mental illness, and a family history of addiction. Researchers are still uncertain what causes addiction, or how it develops as risks vary from person to person.

The purpose of this section is to discuss the six basic theories of addiction, followed by an analysis of Gabor Mate's analysis of how and why addiction develops. To conclude, we will examine some brain scans of addicted individuals and discuss the various categories of addicts that can be identified by these brain scans.
