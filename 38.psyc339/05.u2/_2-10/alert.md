### Activity 2.10: Video | Visual of Emotion Coaching

An excellent illustration of what EFFT's emotion coaching aims to accomplish is Dr. Siegel's hand model.

The hand metaphor can be a very effective way to explain the concept to parents and to our clients.

Watch the following video of Dr. Daniel Siegel presenting a Hand Model of the Brain.
