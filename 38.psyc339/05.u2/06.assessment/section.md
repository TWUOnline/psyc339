## Assessment

Upon completing this unit, including the learning activities, you will need to begin working on the class/oral presentation, which is an individual assignment, as well as your weekly Forum question.

&nbsp;

#### Assignment 1: Class/Oral Presentation (20min)

Students will be divided into groups of 5 and each student will be given one of the topics presented in the units (topics will be assigned by the professor). The jigsaw method will be used as each student is responsible to watch their fellow group members' presentations and provide one comment/question for each. Presentations will be 20 minutes long and will require information from 2 research articles and one community resource pertaining to the student’s topic.  All presentations must be pre-recorded and uploaded to Microsoft Streams by the end of week 5. The professor will go over how to upload videos to Microsoft Streams during Week 2 class.

Each student will then be required to watch their fellow group members' presentations before the start of Week 6 class. Each student will be required to write one comment and one question on each presentation they view (4 presentations) to be handed in before the last day of classes. On the last day of classes there will be time given to answer any clarifying questions related to the presented topics.

You will get assigned to one of the following topics (present on one therapy modality that is used or has been developed for your topic):

+ Complex Trauma
+ Addictions
