### Activity 6.18: Optional Case Study

Please select the viewpoint/approach that you feel most comfortable with and most drawn to for this activity. After reading the following case study, write down how you would begin to approach it. Please consider the following questions:

- What is my view of the client?
- What integration style will I use? How will this inform my sessions? What will I focus on?
- How can I use EFFT in combination with my style (knowing that EFFT is an evidenced based treatment model)

Case Study will be taken from the Counselling and Christianity reading.

_Sandra (31) makes an appointment to speak with her therapist. She and her husband of six years have been active leaders in a thriving church ministry. Her story begins with her decision to step back from all ministry responsibilities due to ‘personal issues.’ Life is crowded with too many demands, and the timing is ripe to reassess even worthwhile commitments. Initially she is hesitant to reveal more._

_The therapist responds by thoughtfully emphasizing how she and her husband have contributed to the discipleship of so many as the home Bible study they direct is a source of solid Christian teaching and revitalizing fellowship. He agrees to pray with her about being sensible and strategic about family priorities. After Sandra hears his perspective on her valuable contribution, her disclosure goes further._
_One month ago to the day, Sandra miscarried for the second time, something few people know. She admits that this is impacting her entire life as she is keeping distant from all of her former friends, all of whom have children. She is beginning to envision what her life might be if she never has a child of her own. Sandra does not imagine that people in the church have any idea of her inner anguish, and if they did, she believes that each would cease to respect her as a follower of Jesus Christ._

_Sandra’s presentation flows steadily with restrained emotion until the therapist inquires gently about the impact on her marriage. She becomes tearful, sobs intermittently and has difficulty putting full sentences together. The ragged explanation reveals that the marriage tension is high and conflicts intense. The most distressing alarm is the escalating rage in the arguments between Sandra and her husband._
