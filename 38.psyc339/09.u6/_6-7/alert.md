Here is a brief overview of what 'A Transformational Psychology View' is:
In the Transformational Psychology View, you can take wisdom from both theological and psychological viewpoints, but we need to re-evaluate what traditional psychology would tell us to be appropriate psychology. Each area of study would need to be viewed through the lens of both reality and faith. Considering the fact that the approach is based on Christian realities, this approach is only suitable for Christians. It is imperative to note that this approach has a great deal to do with the individual and how close the person is to God; the closer the person is to God, the more profound the psychology.
“The bottom line will be that doing science and, in this case, psychology is ultimately an act of love.” (Johnson, 2010, p.199)
