### Activity 6.13: Read | An Integration View - p. 84-90 & 95-99 & 107-108

Take a look at the pdf provided to see how an "Integration View" would appear in the therapy room. It is sometimes difficult to imagine how each of the five approaches would affect the way we work, and this is precisely why Counselling and Christianity: Five Approaches was written. Hopefully, these examples will help solidify how the knowledge is applied.

### Questions to Consider

After the reading, consider the following questions:

1. What does the author believe that integration needs?
2. What are the three legs of the tripod?
3. Describe the role of sanctification in the therapy process as the author sees it.
4. What are the three views of the Imago Dei and what are the implications for counselling?
