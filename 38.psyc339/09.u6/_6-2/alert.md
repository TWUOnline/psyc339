This is a brief overview of the 'Levels of Explanation' View.
The Levels of Explanation view holds that there are many ways of looking at an issue, both psychology and theology are two of these ways. How faith and psychology intersect is that theology or faith provides a lens (and we all come to research and scientific inquiry with a lens) as to how we interpret our findings or even with what we would like and it is important that we acknowledge this lens. Along with our beliefs, everyone also has a self-serving lens through which they view the world. All of these factors need to be taken into account when considering how our faith and psychology fit together.
