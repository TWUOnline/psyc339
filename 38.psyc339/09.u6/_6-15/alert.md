### Activity 6.15: Read | A Transformational Approach p. 135, 140-142, 144 & 154

In the following section, the author does not provide a clear cut way of discussing the implications for the therapy room. As a result, he grapples with the parts that he feels have been overlooked and presents his nuanced interpretation. The intention of this section is to provide you with as much information as possible about the Transformational approach as we have been reading about it.
