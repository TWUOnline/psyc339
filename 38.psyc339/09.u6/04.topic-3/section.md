## Topic 3: Application

You will begin to form your own ideas about how integration applies to your own life and your work with others in this section. We may not spend a great deal of time discussing this area of our lives, but it can have significant implications if we do not. How do you view human nature? How do you view behaviors? What about mental health? What about research or science? What are your main values and how do you tangibly demonstrate them? As psychologists, our research and views have historically been perceived as misaligned with Christian beliefs. How do we reconcile these differences? Do you still believe this to be the case? What parts do you agree with and disagree with? In case there are, why?

Having a framework of understanding is crucial, as it informs how you present yourself and what you do. In EFFT, we have learned that when the internal experience does not match the external experience, alarm bells should sound. This is the case when you hold a certain set of values and these do not match up with the type of work that you are performing. It is difficult to live with such an incongruity. It is possible that we are not even aware that this is occurring.

In this unit and for this section, the goal is to define your values, beliefs, and how you will approach the subject. Even if you are not a Christian, everyone has their own set of values and beliefs, and it is imperative to recognize that even though you are on an ever-changing journey, these are some of the core beliefs I hold on to. These thoughts will be stimulated by the following activity.
