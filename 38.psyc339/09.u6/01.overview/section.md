# Unit 6: Work with Spirituality/Faith in Counselling

![alttext](u6overview.jpg "pebbles balanced near a shore")

## Overview

This is your last unit in this course. Several approaches to living out your faith will be discussed. Psychologists, therapists, and counselors are ethically bound not to explicitly discuss their faith in a counseling session. If you are not directly asked about your faith, you cannot discuss it. Therefore, how should we live in this profession as followers of Christ? We will explore five different perspectives/approaches to integration in this unit. As we proceed through these questions, I invite you to reflect and consider what is most appropriate for you.

&nbsp;

## Topics

This unit is divided into the following topics:

1. What each view/approach to integration is
2. Clinical Implications
3. Application

&nbsp;

## Learning Outcomes

When you have completed this unit, you should be able to:

- Compare and contrast the 5 approaches to counseling and faith.
- Discover and determine which approach best suits each student.
- Understand the parameters of talking about faith and spirituality in the counseling room.
- Discuss one's own faith journey and how it relates to their future profession.
