## Topic 2: Clinical Implications

Our next step will be to investigate what the implications are for the therapy room of the approaches described above. As part of this course, we will read from the book Counselling and Christianity: Five Approaches. The sections that explain how the work appears with each view are available as PDFs. Jake's clinical case will be incorporated into each view.

It is important to note before we begin that regardless of the integration approach that you choose for your own practice (if you choose one at all), as therapists it is our ethical duty to never bring up faith in the room unless the client indicates that he or she is interested. Critical Issues in Human Services, a course that we offer in SOCI 400, focuses on this subject. We will discuss this ethical consideration in more detail if you have not taken this course yet. As a Christian therapist or agency, we must respect the autonomy of the client (the ethical principle) and never assume that this is exactly what the client is seeking.
