# Unit 1: Work with Trauma

Read the Unit 1 overview, unit learning outcomes, topics, activity checklist, and assessments in Moodle to familiarize yourself with student workload expectations.

&nbsp;

### Synchronous Portion

In the synchronous portion of this class, we will focus on, and we will for each unit, going through the EFFT activities. For this unit, we are focusing on understanding the basics of EFFT and so the class will be spent going over a brief introduction to the skill of validation and what it entails. I recommend that you become very familiar with the concepts of emotion coaching and the skill of validation as this is the main skill that the students will come away with at the end of the course.

We will also go over the assignments required, especially the forum expectations and the case conceptualization expectations during this week as it will help the students prepare. Make sure you include this in your synchronous portion.

The final piece that will be covered in the synchronous portion of the course is the students' reactions and questions about the course material. You can use the case study to prompt the discussion of the material and to connect it to the EFFT learning that you present in this unit.

### Learning Activities

This course involves a number of straightforward activities. The readings for this course are taken from a variety of resources and it is important for students to experience gaining information/insight from a variety of resources as this will hopefully help them understand and shape them for their final paper. The instructions for each activity are written in Moodle.

**Activity 1.1: What is Trauma?**
This activity will provide the students with a baseline for what trauma is and how it affects the brain. They will hear from Bessel Vander Kolk who is a prominent researcher in the field of trauma. This will help lay the foundation for the students future learning.  

**Activity 1.2: Read The Body Keeps the Score Prologue**
This activity will be a good segue from the first activity as Bessel Vander Kolk will provide a history of where his research started and came from and he will expand on the question of ‘what is trauma’. This will deepen student’s learning of the topic. The questions help student’s follow along in the course material and pull out the important pieces of learning.

**Optional Activity 1.3: Summary of The Body Keeps the Score Chapter 3**
Students have the option to read chapter 3 of the same book if they have the time, however I have summarized the main components for them. The main takeaway being how difficult it is for trauma victims to talk about their traumas as the speech part of the brain is shut down in the process. He also distinguishes the difference between trauma and stress and why trauma stays with us. Again, very important for the students to understand these aspects of what trauma is as they consider going out into their professional lives and consider working with trauma, or even as they encounter trauma personally.Again this activity is optional as there are many readings required for this course.

**Activity 1.4: A Note on Childhood Trauma/ACE’s**
This topic will highlight for students the longevity and complexity of trauma. The ACE’s test is a popular test administered to discover if you have had exposure to complex trauma. If you have, there can be some implications physiologically, emotionally, spiritually and mentally. Students are encouraged to try taking the test, however it is not required as some of the questions can be triggering.

**Activity 1.5: Defining Terms**
The purpose of this activity is to become familiar with some of the terms in the work of trauma. In looking up the definitions the hope is for students to become more closely acquainted as it interacts with their brain/learning centers on a different level.

**Activity 1.6: Read The Body Keeps the score Chapter 4**
The purpose of this activity is to get into what happens to the brain when trauma occurs, what parts are physically changed, to understand and create more compassion for those experiencing trauma.

**Activity 1.7: Read In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts Chapter 17 & 18**
The purpose of this activity is to explore further what happens to the brain when trauma occurs and this activity will set the students up for their learnings on addictions.

**Activity 1.8: Effects on the Brain: Optional Website exploration**
The purpose of exploring this website is to provide students with a resource for where to go if and when they encounter trauma in their personal or professional lives. This website is a gateway for other resources and sources of information that may be helpful. This activity is optional for students.

**Activity 1.9: Optional Reading “Treating Adult Survivors of Childhood Emotional Abuse and Neglect” Page 3-12**
The purpose of this resource is to open up the discussion on psychological and emotional trauma. In the media we are more exposed to and understand physical and sexual abuse and its traumatic effects, but there is not a lot out there on emotions and psychological trauma in part due to the complexity of defining what it is and how to spot it. This is an optional activity for students.

**Activity 1.10: Optional Reading: Treating Adult Survivors of Emotional Abuse and Neglect**
The purpose of this reading is to unpack a popular treatment modality for psychological and emotional trauma that is based in research. In our class we are mostly focusing on the intervention of EFFT, however it is important to explore this treatment modality as it is specifically designed to deal with the psychological and emotional trauma piece which as we have previously discussed is a harder trauma to spot and at the same time there has been a lot of research done on it lately.This is an optional activity for students.

**Activity 1.11:Optional Reading | Complex Trauma and the Christian Context.**
The purpose of this article is to introduce into the discussion how trauma can interfere and interrupt a person’s belief system and then how their particular treatment model can be structured to aid in this process. It’s important for students to engage in literature that demonstrates how Christianity and Psychology can be connected. This activity is an optional one for students.

**Activity 1.12:Read Pages 3-48 of Emotion Focused Family Therapy Text**
The purpose of this article is to introduce the modality of EFFT and to start understanding the basic concepts as this modality will be used throughout the rest of the course.

**Activity 1.13: Optional Exploration | Explore Some Trauma Informed therapies**
The purpose of this activity is to spend some time exploring other therapy modalities that are used for the treatment of trauma. The purpose is to allow the students an opportunity to become familiar with other treatments so if they end up in the field of therapy or in their conversations with loved ones they will be able to know what to recommend or explore. This is an optional activity for students.

**Activity 1.14: Case Study**
The purpose of this activity is to start to learn to integrate the material learned with a case study presented. The questions to consider ask them to start thinking about what themes they notice from what they have read, and then they are invited to try a validation statement around what is going on for David who is in the case study.
