# Course Evaluation

&nbsp;

### Forum Discussion (25%)
Forum Discussions are an important part of a virtual asynchronous course as it is through this platform that the majority of the discussion takes place. Discussion allows for students to integrate the learning in a different way. See the Assessment description for more information and for rubrics.

**Areas of Focus for marking:**

1. Make sure that students are demonstrating their knowledge of the readings assigned and not just including their own reactions to the topics/questions. Students are allowed to include these reactions, but it shouldn’t be the only part of their post.

2. I would recommend having a due date for the posts to be up each week as this will allow students to stay on top of their postings/readings and will facilitate a more thoughtful discussion. Implementing a due date is more fair to the other students in the class as well as it allows them to make comments on their fellow students' postings on time and their progress is not impeded. As an instructor it also allows you to stay more on top of marking.

3. During the synchronous portion of the class, you can choose to touch base on the discussion question for that week.

4. I would recommend commenting on each student’s post at least once throughout the course.

### Case Conceptualizations (20%)
Six movies have been chosen that correlate with the weekly topics. Students have to choose 3 out of the 6 movies and complete the ‘case conceptualization’ document that is provided to them. This document should demonstrate that they have watched the movie and have put some time and thought into how it relates to the topic covered. Students are allowed to choose any character from the movie, as long as the character is struggling (or their loved one is) with that week's mental health issue. See the assessments section for the grading rubric and further instruction. Marking should be easy for this assignment and you should not spend a lot of time grading it.

### Oral Presentation (20%)
I recommend that as the instructor, you divide the class into groups of 5, and then assign each member a topic. Students are free to ask their group members to switch topics with them- but each topic must be covered in their group as they will be required to watch each others and comment on their videos.

I would recommend that you teach the students how to upload videos into Microsoft streams and that you, as the instructor, will create a ‘folder’ for each group for them to upload their videos into. That way it will be very clear which videos each student will have to watch. I also recommend that you have the students do their comments and questions in Microsoft streams. It involves less documents being handed as well as the opportunity for some discussion/interaction around the presented topic. Emphasize to students that you will NOT watch presentations over the 21 minute mark to save yourself some time as well as some long winded presentations. They should be able to condense what they need to present within this time frame. The minimum time allotted should be 15 minutes.

Students do not need to include a PowerPoint presentation, however in my experience the ones who have not included one have not done as well due to lack of preparedness and veering off track of their topic.

See the Assessment section for more information on what is required.

### Open Book Quiz (20%)

The open book quiz will be made available in Moodle for a week between week 5 and 6 of the course. It will be timed, multiple choice and only attempt is allowed. Students are advised to answer/complete the ‘questions to consider’ portion of each of the units as the questions will be taken solely from those already posed to the students. If the students have a document with the questions and answers, they are allowed to have this with them during the quiz and refer to it. Students are not allowed to take the quiz together or send each other their questions and answer documents. The quiz will be automatically marked for the instructor.

### Research Paper (35%)
The final paper consolidates all of the learning that the students have been doing and practicing. The entire course focuses on the what, why and how of some of the major mental health issues presented in the therapy room. The final paper requires them to choose one of the topics we have covered and expand on it, incorporating their case conceptualization learning from their movie assignments as well as their learning from their oral presentations. Please read the assessment descriptions for more information on the paper requirement.

**Areas of Focus for marking:**
1. This is a third year course and therefore their paper writing skills should demonstrate a knowledge of writing a research paper. I would recommend going the requirements of a research paper in class and going over APA formatting.

2. Follow the grading rubric for how to allot points- I have made it quite specific. The amount of points allotted will demonstrate how much time they should have spent in that section. The students are provided with the detailed rubric as well and therefore this shouldn’t be a surprise to them.

3. The paper should demonstrate the learning from the course.

4. The topic chosen must be a topic that we covered in class.
