### Activity 5.1: Video and Reading | The "Fathers of Stress and Resilience"

### Dr. Hans Seyle

In the world of stress management, Hans Selye is widely acknowledged as the "father of the field." As such, he is a Canadian resource for the rest of the world. Over 1700 scholarly papers and 39 books have been published since Dr. Selye published the first scientific paper to identify and define "stress" in 1936. His work was cited in more than 362,000 scientific papers and in countless popular magazine articles, in nearly every major language and in every country in the world at the time of his death in late 1982. There is no doubt that he is the most frequently cited author on stress issues in the world. Throughout a period of exposure to a nonspecific demand, Selye proposed that stress remains present in the individual's body. Among his distinctions, he called the cumulative effects of chronically applied stressors 'general adaptation syndrome,' also known as Selye's syndrome in the literature.

Dr. Selye is one of the founders of the Canadian Institute of Stress. You may wish to spend a few minutes exploring the following website: <https://stresscanada.org/>

### Norman Garmezy

The resilience theory is regarded as the brainchild of Norman Garmezy, the ‘father’ of resilience theory. In addition to his work in developmental psychopathology, he was a professor of psychology. Garmezy held positions at Duke University (1950–1961) and the Institute of Child Development at the University of Minnesota (1961–1989) after receiving his doctorate from the University of Iowa in 1950. It was his early work that focused on schizophrenia etiology, but his later work focuses on child development risks, resilience, stress, and coping. We will spend some time getting to know his research, even though there have been more advances since his discoveries in the 1980s and 1990s.

We will be reading from Ann Masten’s book, [Ordinary Magic](Ordinary_Magic_Introduction.pdf).

Ann Masten is a prominent resilience researcher and professor of child development at the University of Minnesota. She is widely recognized for her work on resilience in children and how they thrive despite adversity. In her book Ordinary Magic, Masten explores the concept of resilience, arguing that it is not a rare, extraordinary trait but a common capacity that arises from ordinary human resources like supportive relationships, problem-solving skills, and community support. The book highlights the power of everyday systems that foster resilience in individuals facing challenges. Masten studied under Garmezy and take note of when he is mentioned.
