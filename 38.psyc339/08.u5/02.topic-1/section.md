## Topic 1: Stress and Resilience

Stress and its manifestation in the body are the topics we explore in Unit 5. As research shows, experiencing stress is detrimental to our bodies and our health in general. It is therefore very important to develop and expand our resilience in order to properly handle and interact with stress.

In the same manner as in previous units, I would like to acknowledge and hear from those who have contributed to the field of stress and resilience research. Although the scope of research has expanded since then, it is important to recall where we began.
