### Activity 5.11: Case Study

Please refer back to the EFFT manual if you need any reminders on emotion coaching or behavior coaching.

In regards to stress and resilience specifically, I quote this text from our EFFT Manual:

“There is strong evidence to suggest that emotional intelligence (which includes emotion management, emotion perception, and emotion utilization) moderates the relationship between stress and mental health concerns in adolescents and adults, including depression, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation (Ciarrochi, Deane, & Anderson, 2002; Extremera & Fernandez-Berrocal, 2006). Taken together, these studies suggest that a focus on the development and refinement of emotion processing and regulation can serve to buffer against the experience of life stressors. For these reasons, the EFFT clinician also works with caregivers to equip them with the skills of emotion coaching to support their loved one’s wellness. Over time, their loved one develops self-efficacy with emotion processing-that is, the capacity and confidence to experience, tolerate, regulate, and  be guided by their emotions without need of maladaptive coping strategies. In addition to supporting in the moment emotion processing and the development of the capacity to self-regulate, emotion-coaching skills enhance treatment in various ways. As caregivers adopt this new style of relating to their loved one, their relationship will strengthen and their efforts to support their loved one with behavioral symptoms will be more effective and better received. As symptoms decrease, caregivers can also support their loved one to manage the flood of emotions that sometimes follow. This work will also provide loved ones with evidence of their caregiver’s capacity and willingness to support them with their emotional pain, making it more likely that they will turn to the caregiver for support in times of stress” (Lafrance, Henderson & Mayman, 2020).

Read the following Case Study and then spend some time creating a validation statement for this particular client. We will be emotion coaching this client and adding a ‘behavior intervention’ that will help the client to deal with their ongoing stress in their life. You may come up with your own ideas for what may help alleviate stress based on the class readings, your own experience, or you can also look up some suggestions if you would like. Note that you would do a lot more work than just this one emotion coaching before suggesting a way to cope. In real time, you really need to spend time in the validation with them really understanding what they are saying and conveying that you ‘get it’.
