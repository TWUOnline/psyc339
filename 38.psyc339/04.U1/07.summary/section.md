## Unit 1 Summary

In this first unit, you have been introduced to a couple of researchers in the field of trauma as well as developed your ability to conceptualize a case that involves trauma. During this unit, we were only able to touch on the surface of the research that has been conducted in this area. We hope that you will leave this workshop with an understanding of where to turn for assistance, what resources you can access, and how to interact with trauma in therapy.
