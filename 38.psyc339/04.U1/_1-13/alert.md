### Activity 1.13 | Optional Exploration | Trauma Informed therapies

Look up the following modalities to see what types of treatment options are available and notice which modalities resonate with you and why. These modalities do not require in-depth knowledge. Again, the aim is to provide you with a foundation so that when you come across trauma in your work environment, you will already know which modality resonates with you and which you would benefit from further training.
