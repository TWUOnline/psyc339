## Topic 3: How do we work with Trauma?

![alttext](t3overview.jpg "logs")

During this topic, you will become familiar with and comfortable with one main therapeutic approach. The purpose is to give you some practical skills and applications, rather than just a variety of theories that you will need to study further in order to implement. Consequently, this topic may feel more overwhelming than the following, due to the repetition of the same information with a slightly different application. In this section, we will begin by learning about Emotion Focused Family Therapy and then we will apply it specifically to the treatment of trauma.

There are many therapy modalities that are specifically designed for trauma. EFFT is an all encompassing modality and not trauma specific. In your  very last activity you will be provided with  a list of trauma informed therapies that you can pursue at your own leisure. If you come into contact with someone who has complex trauma/PTSD at this stage of your studies, it is best to refer them to someone who is qualified and trained to work with PTSD.

“In our view, successful complex trauma intervention in real-life practice-particularly when conducted with adult survivors of the kind of pervasive and profound deprivation and debasement that comes from living through chronic and severe emotional abuse and neglect in childhood-can almost never be accomplished through adoption of a singular clinical target, follow a consistently linear process, or result from adherence to one specific clinical technique. In contrast, it is tangled, precarious work, work that is predictable in its unpredictability, that inevitably requires the therapists’ extensive use of themselves in the treatment process and that simultaneously demands attention to the body and all that usually goes unspoken in trauma and psychotherapy. (Hopper, Grossman etc, 2021, pg. 14-15)

“When you come from a place where you were not allowed to know what you know or feel what you feel, it can be extraordinarily difficult to find a language for yourself and your inner experience. The presence of a compassionate, safe and reflective therapist is essential to help you discover who you are and what is going on inside. This is never an easy process, and the main task of the therapist is to create physiological stability and the necessary safety to activate the 'watchtower of the mind' (van der Kolk, 2014), where we can compassionately observe ourselves and examine our warring fears, longings and impulses (Hopper, Grossman, Spinazzola, Zucker et al, 2021, xiii).”

These chapters of EFFT contain a great deal of information to process and absorb. As a result, we will not spend much time applying the specific interventions to trauma scenarios in this section.

Please do your own application in the case study below as well as the corresponding forum discussion question. The case study of David provides an opportunity for you to practice the skill of validation. Don't worry if this seems confusing. This scenario will be discussed in class. Also consider how this model could be applied to trauma work theoretically. We will work on specific interventions with our unit topics in future units.
