### Activity 1.8: Optional Website Reading | The Effects of Complex Trauma on Brain Development

Complextrauma.org is an excellent website to familiarize yourself with for research and information about trauma, as well as for resources and opportunities. In addition to defining some terms on this site, I invite you to read this explanation on the impact trauma has on the brain. Hopefully, some of this information will sound familiar to you.
