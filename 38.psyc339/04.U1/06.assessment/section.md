#### Assignment 2:  Forum Discussion Participation

**Questions for Unit 1:**

1. Based on what we learned about the trauma brain in this unit, how would EFFT be a good treatment option? How would emotion coaching specifically (and the science behind it) be beneficial?

!!! Discussions are an important part of this online course. Most discussion postings should be no more than 250 words. You are also asked to read your fellow learner’s postings and then respond to at least two other people.

All postings should be carefully written and edited before being posted. Opinions should be well supported. Your responses should also be communicated in professional language, respectful of others, and to the point. Your assignment will be graded according to the criteria below.
