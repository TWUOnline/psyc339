## What is Depression, Suicidality and Eating Disorders?

Suicidality, eating disorders, and depression are some of the 'main' mental health issues that one might encounter in the therapy room. These issues will only be touched upon in this unit.
In our EFFT text, we have been learning that mental health issues are caused by unprocessed emotions. Rather than going through things that cause mental health issues, it is going through them alone without the ability to process what is happening. According to EFFT, mental health issues would not occur if we were able to process emotions correctly. Both trauma and addiction can be comorbid.

It may seem that the first two topics are disjointed from the previous topics, but the purpose is to pique your interest and introduce you to the researchers and clinicians in this field.
Throughout this unit, I encourage you to draw upon and incorporate what you have learned from the previous units, particularly about the brain and how it interacts with these issues.

#### Depression

The medical term depression (major depressive disorder) refers to a serious, common psychological illness that negatively affects your feelings, your thoughts, and your actions. An individual suffering from depression may experience sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities they previously enjoyed. Depression may also make it difficult for an individual to perform their duties at work or at home. There may be a variety of emotional and physical problems associated with it.

There is a wide range of symptoms associated with depression, ranging from mild to severe. The symptoms include feeling sad or depressed, losing interest in activities that used to be enjoyable, losing weight or gaining weight because of changes in appetite, oversleeping, difficulty sleeping, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty concentrating, thinking, or making decisions, and thoughts of suicide or death.

### Activity: Video | Neuroscience of Depression

::: {.learning-activity time="00"}

I invite you to watch the following YouTube clip to introduce yourself to the different hypothesis out there that are linking brain activity to the development and maintenance of depression.

### Activity: Read | “I don’t want to talk about it” - pdf

::: {.learning-activity time="00"}

In his work as a psychotherapist, Terry Real has made a significant contribution to the discussion and advocacy of male depression. The publication of his book "I don't want to talk about it" created a significant wave in the field of psychology, and he has been presenting on the subject ever since. The author of this book incorporates his own narrative and his own journey through depression into the book. The teaser will only be a brief excerpt, and you are encouraged to read the whole book.

**Questions to consider**

[Read chapter 1: Men’s Hidden Depression](assets/u4/Real_Ch_1.pdf){target="_blank"}

After the reading, consider the following questions:

1. How does this description of his father relate to the intersection of both trauma and depression?
2. Why do we not tend to recognize depression in men?
3. What is the percentage of people that never get help for depression?
4. What, according to Terry Real, produces depression?
5. What are some of the signs of depression in men?
6. What do people tend to view depression as?
7. What compounds a depressed man’s condition?
8. Why do men die earlier than women?
9. What is the stigma around depression?
10. What is covert depression?

Please view the following video clip, not for information regarding psychotherapy or suicide psychology, but rather to understand what Terry Real is describing as male hidden depression in this video.

### Activity: Look over the PHQ-9

::: {.learning-activity time="00"}

Take a moment to read the patient health questionnaire that is used to assess depression in patients. This is one of many scales available.

[https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/health/practitioner-pro/bc-guidelines/depression_patient_health_questionnaire.pdf](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/health/practitioner-pro/bc-guidelines/depression_patient_health_questionnaire.pdf){target="_blank"}

:::

#### Suicidality

Suicidality includes suicide attempts as well as suicidal ideation. A suicidal ideation is the presence of suicidal thoughts. A person may experience suicidal ideation in a variety of ways, from fleeting and unwelcome thoughts to a preoccupation with death that requires extensive planning.

In this section, you will read older sources, which provide a very good explanation of what suicide is. It is important to note, however, that suicide is no longer referred to as someone committing suicide but rather as someone dying by suicide. Having this distinction is important, as it emphasizes the importance of depression and suicide, and how in those extremely dark moments, it would not be a choice to commit suicide.

### Activity: Watch & Read | Shneidman

::: {.learning-activity time="00"}

Edwin Shneidman is known as the “Father of Suicide” and has used the term ‘psychache’ to describe the psychological pain that underlies suicidal acts. Take note in this article of both his name and the reference to his coined term ‘psychache’ as it is one of our goals throughout this course to refer to some of the original researchers.

Watch the following clip of Dr. Shneidman talking about some of his work.

<div class="video-container">

## What Causes It?

The aim of this discussion is to explore some of the potential causes of mental health issues. It’s important to note that identifying a single cause of mental illness is often difficult, as multiple factors can contribute to its development. As we have previously discussed, these factors may include early adverse life experiences, such as trauma, as well as a history of abuse, whether directly experienced or witnessed. Refer back to the diagram we looked at earlier, which outlines the various contributors to the development of mental health issues. Extensive research also shows that mental health problems can be linked to chronic medical conditions like cancer or diabetes. Additionally, biological factors, chemical imbalances in the brain, and changes in brain structure due to alcohol or drug use can play significant roles. Our brains, bodies, and emotions are deeply interconnected, making it challenging to pinpoint direct causes and effects.

We will discuss some of the research behind why these mental health issues occur in this section. As we continue our study of the brain, draw upon the knowledge you have gained from your previous units. The topic of depression will be discussed first, followed by suicidality and then eating disorders.

#### Depression

While depressive disorders are often labelled as chemical imbalances, this oversimplifies their complexity. Research shows that depression isn’t simply caused by a lack or excess of certain brain chemicals. Factors like faulty mood regulation, genetic vulnerability, and stressful life events all contribute, often interacting with one another. Individuals with similar symptoms of depression may have entirely different underlying causes and respond to different treatment approaches.

### Activity: Read | “I don’t want to talk about it…” Chapter 4

::: {.learning-activity time="00"}

Terry Real's book provides insight into how and why depression develops. This chapter will focus on the relationship between trauma and depression, which we discussed extensively in our first unit.

As you will see in the following chapter, Terry Real is a very systemic therapist. Notice the emphasis on process rather than content - HOW the client is showing up rather than what the client wishes to discuss or share. Observe how Terry Real's approach relates to our learning of EFFT.

**Reflect**

+ In what state is the author in despair and what questions does he ask?
+ Is there anything in this that stirs your emotions?

:::

#### Suicide

Suicide ideation is a very prevalent issue in our society. For those who have never experienced suicide ideation, or being close to that moment of contemplation, it can be difficult to imagine the reasoning behind why this can occur. We will explore in this next section why suicide ideation might occur and why the ideation can lead to dying by suicide. As with our previous units, we will spend time looking at the brain and what brain activity occurs when suicide ideation is present.

### Activity: Video | Suicide and the brain

::: {.learning-activity time="00"}

Dr. Amen is a prominent researcher who studies the brain in relation to mental health problems; we have previously discussed some of his work.

He is not a very empathetic speaker and some do not agree with some of his approaches (for example guilting clients). Nevertheless, he is a solid researcher and it is important to understand his perspective and how he looks at the brain.

## How We Work with It

To effectively assist a client or friend or family member with a mental health issue, it is helpful to know what resources are available both to support the client or loved one as well as to support you. As there are many variables to consider when treating mental health issues, each client's treatment will differ. This topic will include readings and activities designed to facilitate this learning.

EFFT was developed as a result of studies conducted with people who suffer from eating disorders. Thus, you will find this section to be complementary to your learning of EFFT. We will begin by exploring some of the community resources that are available.

### Activity: Explore | Community Resources

::: {.learning-activity time="00"}

Do you have access to any resources in the area where you work? When a crisis arises, how can you help? The following are just a few options available; we recommend exploring more.

### Activity: Practice | Emotion Coaching/Behavior Coaching

::: {.learning-activity time="00"}

In this section, we will practice our skills of Emotion Coaching and Behavior Coaching. While this may seem repetitive, the more you practice, the easier it will become. The EFFT manual contains suggestions for behavior coaching strategies for depression, as well as what depression requires in terms of emotional support. As an example, consider a scenario in which a parent seeks your assistance with their child who is suffering from depression. You will assist the parent in developing a script that they can use at home with their children.

### Activity: EFFT and Suicidality

::: {.learning-activity time="00"}

In order to conduct a preliminary assessment, it is extremely important to understand the signs of possible suicidal behavior. In accordance with the literature, the risk assessment should not be regarded as an absolute. Continual monitoring and assessment are essential, especially at the beginning of your career. One of the exceptions to confidentiality, if you have not yet taken SOCI 400, is when there is a risk of harm to oneself or another. Whenever you suspect that your client's life is in danger, you must report it to the appropriate authorities.

- [Suicide Risk: Detecting & Assessing Suicidality](https://www.camh.ca/en/professionals/treating-conditions-and-disorders/suicide-risk/suicide---detecting-and-assessing-suicidality){target="_blank"}

For this section on suicide, you will write a validation statement that explains why someone might commit suicide. Suicide is one of the most difficult issues to validate, since when we validate it, especially with this one, we feel as though we are encouraging the individual to carry out the action. In keeping with what we have read and what research shows, it actually gives the other the feeling that they are not alone-that someone understands and is willing to share dark places with them.

This validation statement will not be accompanied by an actual scenario. Imagine someone sitting in front of you saying, "I want to end my life," and think about why they might want to do so.

### Activity: EFFT and Eating Disorders

::: {.learning-activity time="00"}

It has been shown in the literature that parental body image (in particular, a mother's) and eating habits can be associated with the manifestation of an eating disorder in their loved one. Note that this is a correlation and not a causation. This is important for relieving caregiver self blame and to then empower a caregiver/parent to become a part of the healing process. There is evidence to support the benefits of caregiver involvement in the literature we have been reading.

If a caregiver has struggled or continues to struggle with an eating disorder or body dysmorphia, this may hinder their ability to participate in the healing process of their loved one.

## Summary {.unnumbered}

You have learned about three different major mental health issues in this fourth unit, depression, suicidality, and eating disorders. As part of this unit, you have learned what a mental health issue is, why it occurs, and how it can be dealt with considering the resources available. Additionally, you have practiced with case scenarios. Having acquired a broad understanding of each mental health issue, you will be prepared to begin validating these very difficult conditions. In the event that you were triggered or stirred up in any way by this unit's discussions, I encourage you to take care of yourself and seek out someone to talk to as well as implement any other grounding techniques you find helpful.
