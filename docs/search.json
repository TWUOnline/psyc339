In order to equip you to think truthfully, act justly, and live faithfully for the good of the world and the glory of God, we know that you must grow in your ability to engage in geunine critical thinking, generate original work, and express your own ideas in an organized and clear manner. Quite simply, generative AI tools can shortcut that process. We urge you to avoid thinking of your education as transactional (produce something, get a grade, get a degree) and instead consider it as transformational (helping you to become a better human being).\nAt the same time, we also understand that we are preparing you for a life and career after graduation wherein the use of generative AI tools will become more commonplace. To that end, we hope to guide you toward its use in ethical ways that do not shortcut the overall purpose of your education but rather enhance it.\nYour responsibility is to ensure that you understand the ethical and legal issues inherent in the use of these tools, avoid the use of any tool that shortcuts the learning process, and pay close attention to the expectations that each of your professors has based on the learning outcomes for each course that you take at TWU.

    "section": "Trauma",
    "text": "Trauma\nTrauma is a very difficult mental health issue to work with. A trauma is a painful, confusing, intergenerational, illogical, interfering, irrational, and shocking experience. The treatment of trauma requires more than a series of four to five sessions; it can be a lengthy and complex process with advances and setbacks.\nA trauma can manifest itself in many different ways. Dr. Joseph Spinazzola and Dr. Bessel van der Kolk are prominent researchers in the field of trauma and emphasize that it is not the traumatic incident that remains with people and affects them, but rather unprocessed emotions and going through trauma alone that remains with them. This is also emphasized by Dr. Adele LaFrance, the co-creator of emotionally-focused family therapy (EFFT).\nThe culture of our society is so geared toward avoiding pain at any cost that when it does emerge we attempt to shut it down and conceal it before it causes too much damage. It is in the avoidance of pain, in the avoidance of the traumatic event, that darkness and maladaptive coping skills emerge, which are often what bring people into therapy.\nIn the course of working with trauma as therapists, we have the tendency to desire a quick fix or to avoid entering into the dark pit of pain. It can be difficult to navigate this fine line between going too far and experiencing secondary trauma, and avoiding feeling the pain with our clients. As a consequence, we would like to warn you that some of the stories and case studies we will be discussing in this course may be triggering or difficult to listen to. Take note of your ability to engage with the material as the intention is not to create dysregulation within you.\n\nActivity: What is Trauma?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the following videos and listen to Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, one of the most prominent trauma researchers, then answer the following questions. You may want to watch the first video more than once since a lot of information is packed into a short timeframe.\n\nWhat is Trauma? The Author of “The Body Keeps the Score” Explains (2021)\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Ways Trauma Can Change the Brain (2014)\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYou will be able to check your understanding of the topic by considering these questions.\n\nWhat is the difference between stress and trauma?\nHow does van der Kolk define trauma?\nWhy does it make a difference whether or not PTSD develops if a caregiver or parent is there for us after a traumatic event occurs?\nWhat does van der Kolk name as the primitive/survival part of the brain?\nWhat emotions do traumatized people have trouble experiencing?\nWhat are the three areas that are affected in those who have experienced childhood trauma?\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity: Reading | The Body Keeps the Score, Prologue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReading the prologue to Dr. van der Kolk’s book will provide you a good introduction to trauma and to his experience and work with it.\n\nThe Body Keeps the Score, Prologue (2014)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYou will be able to check your understanding of the topic by considering these questions.\n\nWhat are some examples of how trauma affects not only the individual, but also those around the individual?\nWhat types of physiological change does trauma reproduce?\nWhat are the three approaches used in helping heal traumatized individuals?\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity: Optional Reading | The Body Keeps the Score, Chapter 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you plan to work with traumatized individuals, Chapter 3 in The Body Keeps the Score is an excellent suggested resource for you.\n\nThe Body Keeps the Score, Chapter 3 (2014)\n\nHighlights from the reading are described in the following paragraphs (van der Kolk, 2014):\nOne of the main findings in a study that was conducted by examining the brain with MRI is that trauma is preverbal. While undergoing brain scans, research participants were simultaneously triggered with reminders of their individual traumas. Through this experiment it was discovered that Broca’s area in the brain (where speech resides) was shut down, or dark on the MRI. This is a major finding as it tells us that the connection between speech and what is happening is disconnected. Similarly, it was shown that when something happens to remind traumatized people of their trauma, their right brain responds as if the event was happening in the present, while their left side of the brain is shut down, which can block the realization that the event is not happening in real time. This is all experienced in the bodily-felt sense. This therefore means that the experience of trauma itself can get in the way of talking about the trauma. This piece of information is crucial to know as therapists, because the process of change in the therapy room often involves talking.\nvan der Kolk also describes trauma succinctly in this chapter. He describes trauma as something that happens to you that makes you so upset that it overwhelms you and there is nothing you can do to help yourself function in the face of the particular event. Trauma is how you respond to it.\n\n\n\n\nActivity: A Note on Childhood Trauma and Adverse Childhood Experiences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two sections to this activity. In the first, Dr. van der Kolk explains how trauma manifests in children, and in the second, pediatrician Nadine Burke Harris shares during a TED Talk the importance of acknowledging childhood trauma and how it impacts our physical well-being.\n\nBessel van der Kolk on the Treatment of Trauma: How Childhood Trauma is Different from PTSD(2013)\n\n\n\n\nPediatrician Nadine Burke Harris explains that the repeated stress of abuse, neglect, and parents struggling with mental health or substance abuse issues has real, tangible effects on the development of the brain. Watch the following video:\n\nHow Childhood Trauma Affects Health Across a Lifetime (2015)\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYou will be able to check your understanding of the topic by considering these questions.\n\nHow does PTSD manifest in children?\nWhat areas of the brain does trauma affect?\nWhy are children more sensitive to brain change from trauma?\n\nTo gain a better understanding of your own past experiences, you can take the following short adverse childhood experience (ACE) quiz found on the website below. It is important to note that participation in this activity is not mandatory, nor will you be asked to share your experiences. Please proceed with caution and awareness as the questions and discoveries may be triggering.\n\nTake Your ACE Test (n.d.)\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity: Terminology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis activity will introduce you to some of the concepts and terminology used in this field by looking up the following terms. The website given here is recommended for searching the terms listed in the tool below. By doing the search yourself you are more likely to remember the definitions. Try to write out or type out the definitions instead of just copying and pasting them. This section aims to define these terms at the end of the section rather than at the beginning so you will recognize some of them and have a context from the resources you have read.\n\nComplex Trauma Resources (n.d.)\n\nUse the tool below to assist you in this activity.

    "text": "Why and How Does Trauma Happen?\nTo develop a preliminary understanding of why trauma occurs, you have learned defining terms in the previous topic. This topic will focus on why and how PTSD develops and persists—we often tend to focus on the “why” of abuse; however PTSD is not something to discuss in the beginning. The learning activities included in this topic will allow you to explore the reasons why the brain and body can perceive an event as if it were happening right now, even when an event or series of events occurred in the past. Furthermore, the resources will discuss what happens to our brains when trauma occurs and persists over time. Despite some repetition in the resources, the expectation is that you will retain more of the information by digesting it through various sources and formats.\n\nActivity: Reading | The Body Keeps the Score, Chapter 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite being potentially overwhelming, this chapter is extremely informative regarding what happens to the brain when trauma occurs. Please use the following questions to guide your reading, as they will assist you in focusing on the most important information.\n\nWatch What is trauma? The author of “The Body Keeps the Score” explains | Bessel van der Kolk | Big Think.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead The Body Keeps the Score, Chapter 4 (2014)\n\n\n“When you can’t be fully here, you go to the places where you did feel alive—even if those places are filled with horror and misery (van der Kolk, p. 73).”\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYou will be able to check your understanding of the topic by considering the following questions.\n\nWhat happens to the brain when the normal response is blocked?\nWhat are the five things our brains need to do in order to ensure our survival?\nWhat does “neurons that fire together, wire together” mean?\nWhat are frontal lobes responsible for?\nWhat are mirror neurons?\nWhat is the difference between top-down regulation and bottom-up regulation?\nWhy can flashbacks and reliving trauma almost be worse than experiencing the trauma?\nWhat parts of the brain need to be “online” in order to visit past traumatic memories?\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity: Reading | In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts, Chapters 17 and 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGabor Maté’s book, In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts (2010), focuses on addiction. You may want to spend some time reading Chapters 17 and 18 to better understand how addiction and trauma are intertwined.\nMaté is famous for saying, “don’t ask why the addiction, but why the pain.” He would state that every person who has an addiction has experienced trauma (Maté, 2010). Thus, we will read a few chapters from the book that describe how the brain develops and works. Observe how Maté describes both physical trauma and emotional trauma. The need for strong attachment figures from a young age has been discussed and will continue to be discussed—this section explains the effects on the brain and brain development. Our next unit on addiction will benefit from investigating the effects on the brain.\n\nIn the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters With Addiction (2010)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYou will be able to check your understanding of the topic by considering the following questions.\n\nHow much smaller do mistreated children’s brains tend to be?\nWhat part of the brain tends to be smaller in trauma survivors? What is this part of the brain responsible for?\nWhat is the stress hormone called?\nWhat does early stress establish in a child?\nHow does early abuse and neglect affect interpersonal relationships?\nWhat are three universal factors that lead to stress?\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity: Optional Website Reading | The Effects of Complex Trauma on Brain Development\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplextrauma.org is an excellent website to familiarize yourself with for research and information about trauma, as well as for resources and opportunities. In addition to using this site to define some terms, I invite you to read the following explanation of the impact trauma has on the brain. Hopefully, some of this information will sound familiar to you.\n\nThe Effects of Complex Trauma on Brain Development (n.d.)\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity: Optional Reading | Treating Adult Survivors of Childhood Emotional Abuse and Neglect, pp. 3–12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiterature in this section discusses emotional abuse or neglect and psychological trauma. Emotional and psychological trauma is a relatively new and complex area of trauma study, and it is crucial that we learn how this affects the systems in which we live, work, and commune. As you read this section, keep the authors’ working definition of complex trauma in the back of your mind—they identify complex trauma as defined by Courtois (2004) and Courtois & Ford, (2010):\n“Courtois (2004) articulated … complex trauma as a recurrent and escalating form of trauma, occurring primarily within familial or intimate relationships … requiring survival to take precedence over normal psychobiological development” (Courtois & Ford, 2010, as cited in Hopper et al., 2021, p. 9).\nAdditionally, they note that the Complex Trauma Workgroup has a similarly developmentally anchored definition of complex trauma as “a dualistic, pernicious, and progressive relationship between exposure and adaptation” (as cited in Hopper et al., 2021, p. 9).\n\nRead pages 3 to 12 in Treating Adult Survivors of Childhood Emotional Abuse and Neglect: Component-Based Psychotherapy (2021)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYou will be able to check your understanding of the topic by considering the following questions.\n\nCan you describe the difference between emotional abuse versus emotional neglect?\nWhy does psychological maltreatment in the home still largely remain in a gray area? What factors make it hard to identify or intervene?\nWhat is psychological abuse the strongest predictor of?\nHow does Courtois (2004) define complex trauma?\nWhat is the difference between Type I trauma and Type II trauma?\nWhat do the acronyms PTSD, CPTSD, and DTD stand for?",

In this section, we will begin by learning about emotion-focused family therapy (EFFT) and then we will apply it specifically to the treatment of trauma.\nThere are many therapy modalities that are specifically designed for trauma; EFFT is an all-encompassing modality and not trauma-specific. In the final activity you will be provided with a list of trauma-informed therapies that you can pursue at your own leisure. If you come into contact with someone who has complex trauma or PTSD at this stage of your studies, it is best to refer them to someone who is qualified and trained to work with PTSD.\n\nIn our view, successful complex trauma intervention in real-life practice—particularly when conducted with adult survivors of the kind of pervasive and profound deprivation and debasement that comes from living through chronic and severe emotional abuse and neglect in childhood—can almost never be accomplished through adoption of a singular clinical target, follow a consistently linear process, or result from adherence to one specific clinical technique. In contrast, it is tangled, precarious work, work that is predictable in its unpredictability, that inevitably requires the therapists’ extensive use of themselves in the treatment process and that simultaneously demands attention to the body and all that usually goes unspoken in trauma and psychotherapy. (Hopper et al., 2021, pp. 14–15)\n\n\nActivity: Optional Reading | Treating Adult Survivors of Childhood Emotional Abuse and Neglect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the following article for a description of a new framework for treating childhood emotional abuse and neglect. This article describes component-based psychotherapy. This is not an essential therapy for you to know as we will be focusing on learning about emotionally-focused family therapy in our time together, but if you are interested in working with trauma or have done so previously, I would recommend reading this article.\n\nTreating Adult Survivors of Childhood Emotional Abuse and Neglect (2021)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYou will be able to check your understanding of the topic by considering the following questions.\n\nWhat are the three predominant paradigms that have emerged regarding traumatic stress inquiry and research?\nWhat does CBP stand for? What are some preliminary characteristics of the model?\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity: Optional Reading | Complex Trauma and the Christian Context\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn adult with complex trauma history frequently experiences disrupted systems of meaning, which can lead to adversely affected belief systems. The experiences of shame, betrayal, meaning-making, and mourning experienced by adult survivors of childhood trauma often complicate their spiritual or religious beliefs. The goal of this activity is to provide you with a better understanding of how a complex trauma treatment is applied within a Christian context.\n\nBeyond Survival: Application of a Complex Trauma Treatment Model in the Christian Context (2015)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYou will be able to check your understanding of the topic by considering the following questions.\n\nWhy is it vital for a therapist to “know thyself” as this article highlights? How can a therapist’s own religion or faith get in the way of trauma therapy?\nWhat is the importance of relational rupture and repair? What are the reasons for allowing therapeutic ruptures to occur?\nWhy is the skill of validation important?\nWhy would it be beneficial to explore a client’s view of God and God’s view of themselves?\nWhat is MBCT and how can it be beneficial?\nWhy is it easy in a Christian environment to confuse dysregulated behaviour with willful sin?\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity: Reading | Emotion-Focused Family Therapy, pp. 3–48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead pages 3–48 in your course resource below. The purpose of this unit is to process this new model and make our own deductions regarding how this model may be applied to the treatment of trauma.\n\nEmotion-Focused Family Therapy: A Transdiagnostic Model for Caregiver-Focused Interventions (2020)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYou will be able to check your understanding of the topic by considering the following questions.\n\nWhat is EFFT?\nWhat are the core principles of EFFT?\nWhat are advanced caregiving skills?\nWhat are the six pillars of EFFT?\nWhat are some of the themes that research of EFFT has shown?\nWhat areas does the bridge responsible for emotion regulation connect? (which parts of the brain?)\nWhat are some of the benefits of emotion coaching?\nWhat happens over time when emotion coaching is present?\nWhat is a super feeler?\nWhat are the five steps of emotion coaching?\nWhat is the two-step model of emotion coaching?\nWhat is the “good house–bad house” metaphor?\n\n\n\n\nWhen you come from a place where you were not allowed to know what you know or feel what you feel, it can be extraordinarily difficult to find a language for yourself and your inner experience. The presence of a compassionate, safe, and reflective therapist is essential to help you discover who you are and what is going on inside. This is never an easy process, and the main task of the therapist is to create physiological stability and the necessary safety to activate the “watchtower of the mind” (van der Kolk, 2014), where we can compassionately observe ourselves and examine our warring fears, longings and impulses. (Hopper et al., 2021, xiii)\n\nThe chapters of our EFFT resource contain a great deal of information to process and absorb. As a result, we will not spend much time applying specific interventions to trauma scenarios in this section.\nPlease do your own application in the case study below, as well as the corresponding Forum Discussion question. The case study provides an opportunity for you to practice the skill of validation. Don’t worry if this seems confusing. This scenario will be discussed in class. Also consider how this model could be applied to trauma work theoretically. We will work on specific interventions in future units.\n\n\nActivity: Optional Exploration | Trauma-Informed Therapies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook up the following modalities to see what types of treatment options are available and notice which modalities resonate with you and why. These modalities do not require in-depth knowledge. Again, the aim is to provide you with a foundation so that when you encounter trauma in your work environment, you will already know which modality resonates with you and in which you would benefit from further training.\n\nEMDR Therapy: Demonstration & Step-by-Step Walkthrough (2021)\nNarrative Exposure Therapy (NET) (2025)\nOrigin of Somatic Experiencing (2012)\nInternal Family Systems & CBP & AEDP & STAIR/MPE (2019)\nARC Therapy (2020)\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity: Case Study\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake note of the following questions as you read the case study below.

Grieving can be challenging in a culture that often ignores loss and avoids discussing its impact, as H. Norman Wright points out at the start of his book, Experiencing Grief, which you’ll have the opportunity to read later in this unit. Wright notes, “When we add this silence to the fact that most of us have never been taught about the process and normalcy of grief and death, no wonder we struggle” (2004, p. 1).\nOur fear and pain surrounding death are intensified by the uncertainty it brings, raising questions that lack definitive answers. For those with faith, their belief can provide some comfort—a sense of peace about what comes after death. However, this comfort does not eliminate the pain of losing a loved one, the suffering that may precede death, or the lingering questions and anxieties that often accompany it. As we’ve discussed in earlier units, the experience of suffering and pain is something we naturally strive to avoid at all costs.\nAs with the previous unit, this unit also deals with trauma. In the same way that death can cause trauma to the body, it can cause suffering to the brain of those left behind as well. This unit will not go into detail about how the brain is affected, but keep in mind what you learned from the first unit about trauma and the brain.\nThis unit is divided into the following topics:",

    "text": "Summary\nDuring this unit you have been able to learn about grief and dying from the perspective of the dying, as well as the perspective of those left behind. Upon completion of this unit you will hopefully have a better understanding of how to begin interacting with death, the systemic view of death, dying, and the elderly, as well as the importance of confronting our own fears and hesitations concerning death before we are able to assist our clients. Being the “conversation starters” about death also places us in a position to be an instrument of change. Creating more of a comfort and vocabulary around death, grieving, and loss on a societal level will create huge change on the systemic level.

An individual suffering from depression may experience sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities they previously enjoyed. Depression may also make it difficult for an individual to perform their duties at work or at home. There may be a variety of emotional and physical problems associated with it.\nThere is a wide range of symptoms associated with depression, ranging from mild to severe. These include feeling sad or depressed, losing interest in activities that used to be enjoyable, losing weight or gaining weight because of changes in appetite, oversleeping, difficulty sleeping, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty concentrating, thinking, or making decisions, and thoughts of suicide or death.\n\nActivity: Video | Neuroscience of Depression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI invite you to watch the following YouTube clip to introduce yourself to the various hypotheses that link brain activity to the development and maintenance of depression.\n\n10-Minute Neuroscience: Depression (2023)\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nWhat are some of the hypotheses that this video covers?\nWhat has been the traditional or original hypothesis?

The publication of his book I Don’t Want to Talk About It (1998) created a significant wave in the field of psychology, and he has been presenting on the subject ever since. Real incorporates his own narrative and his own journey through depression into the book. The teaser below is only a brief excerpt, and you are encouraged to read the whole book.\n\nMen’s Hidden Depression, Chapter 1 (1998)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter reading the chapter consider the following questions:\n\nHow does this description of Real’s father relate to the intersection of both trauma and depression?\nWhy do we tend not to recognize depression in men?\nWhat is the percentage of people who never get help for depression?\nWhat, according to Real, produces depression?\nWhat are some of the signs of depression in men?\nWhat do people tend to view depression as?\nWhat compounds a depressed man’s condition?\nWhy do men die earlier than women?\nWhat is the stigma around depression?\nWhat is covert depression?\n\nPlease view the following video, not for information regarding psychotherapy or suicide psychology, but rather to understand what Terry Real is describing as male hidden depression in this video.\n\nWhat I Learned From My Husband’s Suicide (2020)\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity: Familiarize Yourself With the PHQ-9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a moment to read a patient health questionnaire that is commonly used to assess depression in patients.

A person may experience suicidal ideation in a variety of ways, from fleeting and unwelcome thoughts, to a preoccupation with death that requires extensive planning.\nIn this section you will read older sources which provide a very good explanation of what suicide is. It is important to note, however, that we no longer refer to someone as committing suicide, but rather as someone dying by suicide. Making this distinction is important, as it emphasizes the importance of depression and suicide, and how in those extremely dark moments, it would not be a choice to commit suicide.\n\nActivity: Watch & Read | Shneidman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdwin Shneidman is known as the “father of suicide” and has used the term “psychache” to describe the psychological pain that underlies suicidal acts.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nIn Unit 5, both stress and resilience will be explored in detail. While these may appear to be distinct topics, they are deeply interconnected. Stress is an inevitable part of life, arising from various external and internal pressures, while resilience is the capacity to adapt and bounce back from these challenges. The relationship between the two is significant: the more resilient we become, the better we are at managing stress. Although stress will always exist, a resilient individual can approach it differently, viewing obstacles as opportunities for growth rather than insurmountable difficulties. Resilience doesn’t eliminate stress, but it transforms the way we interact with it. With greater resilience, stressful situations are less likely to overwhelm us, and we develop healthier coping mechanisms. Instead of being paralyzed or drained by stress, resilience empowers us to stay grounded, think clearly, and respond effectively. Through building resilience, we gain the tools to reduce the impact of stress on our emotional, mental, and even physical well-being. In other words, by strengthening our resilience, we can significantly alter our experience of stress, making it less of a burden and more of a manageable part of our personal and professional lives.",

    "text": "2.1 Stress and Resilience\nStress and its manifestation in the body are the topics we explore in Unit 5. As research shows, experiencing stress is detrimental to our bodies and our health in general. It is therefore very important to develop and expand our resilience in order to properly handle and interact with stress.\nIn the same manner as in previous units, I would like to acknowledge and hear from those who have contributed to the field of stress and resilience research. Although the scope of research has expanded greatly, it is important to recall where we began.\n\n2.1.1 Activity: Video and Reading | The “Fathers” of Stress and Resilience\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 00 minutesminutes\n\n\n\nDr. Hans Seyle\nIn the world of stress management, Hans Selye is widely acknowledged as the “father of the field.” As such, he is a Canadian resource for the rest of the world. Over 1,700 scholarly papers and 39 books were published by Dr. Selye following his first scientific paper to identify and define “stress” in 1936. His work was cited in more than 362,000 scientific papers and in countless popular magazine articles, in nearly every major language, and in every country in the world by the time of his death in late 1982. There is no doubt that he is the most frequently cited author on stress in the world. Selye proposed that throughout a period of exposure to a nonspecific demand, stress remains present in an individual’s body. Among his distinctions, Selye called the cumulative effects of chronically applied stressors “general adaptation syndrome,” also known as Selye’s syndrome in the literature.\nDr. Selye is one of the founders of the Canadian Institute of Stress. You may wish to spend a few minutes exploring their website (2024).\nWatch the following video to learn more about one of Dr. Hans Selye’s major contributions to stress research. Please note that the video is 4:01 minutes long.\n\nHans Selye’s General Adaption Syndrome and the HPA Axis: Exploring the Connection (2017)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter viewing the video consider the following questions and use them as a tool to help you process the information.\n\nWhat is general adaptation syndrome?\nWhat is it better described as?\nWhat is the HPA? How can it weaken?\n\nNorman Garmezy\nThe resilience theory is regarded as the brainchild of Norman Garmezy, the “father” of resilience theory. In addition to his work in developmental psychopathology, Garmezy was a professor of psychology; he held positions at Duke University (1950–1961) and the Institute of Child Development at the University of Minnesota (1961–1989) after receiving his doctorate from the University of Iowa in 1950. His early work focused on the etiology of schizophrenia, but his later work focused on child development risks, resilience, stress, and coping. We will spend some time getting to know his research, even though there have been further advances since his discoveries in the 1980s and 1990s.\nWe will be reading from Ann Masten’s book, Ordinary Magic ( ).\nAnn Masten is a prominent resilience researcher and professor of child development at the University of Minnesota. She is widely recognized for her work on resilience in children and how they thrive despite adversity. In her book Ordinary Magic, Masten explores the concept of resilience, arguing that it is not a rare, extraordinary trait but a common capacity that arises from ordinary human resources such as supportive relationships, problem-solving skills, and community support. The book highlights the power of everyday systems that foster resilience in individuals facing challenges. Masten studied under Garmezy—take note of when he is mentioned.\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter completing the reading above, consider the following questions and use them as a tool to help you process the information.\n\nThe key individuals who initiated studies on resilience in children were a part of which historic event?\nWhat are the four waves of resilience science?\nWhat was the biggest surprise that emerged from the study of children who overcome adversity?\nWhat does the word resilience mean?\nWhat two kinds of evaluation are required to identify resilience in a person’s life?\nWhat are some examples of risk factors?\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Activity: Reading | The Meaning of Stress, Chapter 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 00 minutesminutes\n\n\n\nTo begin our conversation on stress and its meaning, please read the resource below.\n\nStress Management and Prevention, Chapter 1 ( )\n\nThis chapter’s Key Questions will be used as our Questions to Consider section. Reading these ahead of time will assist you in guiding your reading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the learning activities in this course are ungraded, unless specified. They are designed to help you succeed in your assessments in this course, so you are strongly encouraged to complete them.\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter reading, consider the following questions and use them as a tool to help you process the information.\n\nWhat are the different ways that stress can be defined and conceptualized?\nWhat are the different ways that people respond to adversity in their lives?\nStress is ordinarily thought of as a fairly negative state, something to be avoided whenever possible. But how can stress be highly functional and operate as a survival mechanism?\nWhat is the general adaptation syndrome (GAS) and how does it function during times of stress?\nWhat is the primary goal of stress management? Can such a program completely eliminate stress?\nWhat are major sources of stress and how are they recognized?\nHow do you interpret the following statement: Stress is not what exists on the outside, but how you perceive a situation on the inside?\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Activity: Optional Reflection | Stress\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 00 minutesminutes\n\n\n\nConsider the following questions and use the tool below to save your notes.

Throughout his work he emphasizes the importance of resilience. Rather than reading some of his books and articles, we will view some of his YouTube talks:\nBuilding Resilience\n\nBuilding Resilience in Care Providers (2019)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter watching the video consider the following questions and use them as tools to help you process the information.\n\nWhat are the five states of empathy?\nWhat does compassion build on?\nWhat are the two states of the brain that Siegel describes?\nWhat is the metaphor that Siegel uses about the importance of awareness with resiliency?\n\nOpportunities to Build the Circuits of Kindness and Resilience\nThis next video focuses on parents building resilience with their children.\n\nBuilding the Circuits for Kindness and Resilience (2012)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter watching the video consider the following questions and use them as tools to help you process the information.\n\nWhen are the first circuits of kindness and resilience growing?\nWhat moments does Siegel encourage us to reframe?\nHow do you see this video by Siegel as related to issues that EFFT explores?\nWhat is the opportunity to build kindness and resilience that Siegel talks about?",

    "text": "2.2 The Development of Stress and Resilience\nThe purpose of this section is to discuss how and why stress occurs, and how we can enhance our resilience to minimize stress; that is, as Siegel explains, by increasing our awareness, we will be able to handle things with less impact when they occur—despite the fact that they may still affect us, they will not have the same negative impact.\n\n2.2.1 Activity: Read | Stress Management and Prevention, Chapter 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 00 minutesminutes\n\n\n\nIn this chapter we will examine how stress manifests in the body and how our body responds to stress. We should note that this is a continuation or a parallel from our previous learning about trauma. You are not expected to memorize all of the details or remember all of the parts of the body affected. This article is intended to give you a general understanding of how stress affects the body and how it can manifest itself.\nRead p. 30 to the end of the chapter. Pay particular attention to pages 36–37, and observe how they are aligned with our understanding of EFFT. The Questions to Consider section will be based on the Key Questions in the chapter. By reading these ahead of time, you will be able to guide your reading.\n\nStress Management and Prevention, Chapter 2 ( )\n\nQuestions to Consider\nConsider the following questions and use them as tools to help you process the information.\n\nWhy is it important to study the physiological basis of stress responses?\nHow can you apply what you learned in this chapter to understand better why people struggle so much in their lives?\nHow can studying the physiology of stress assist you in making sense of your own stress reactions, as well as those you witness in others?\nHow do chronic stress and anxiety affect the various systems in the body?\nHow do the nervous and endocrine systems work together to coordinate the body’s responses to stress?\nHow do the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems work in concert to control physiological stress responses?\nWhat are the body’s sequential steps in responding to perceived threats?\nHow is the immune system affected by chronic stress?\nWhat are the risk factors associated with heart disease and other chronic health conditions?\nHow is sexual functioning affected by chronic or acute stress?\nWhat are some ways that stress is helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Activity: Video | An Illustration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 00 minutesminutes\n\n\n\nThis video with Dr. Gabor Maté on the connection between stress and disease illustrates how the body and the brain are connected and how stress manifests itself in the body.

    "text": "2.3 Strategies for Dealing with Stress and Resilience\nBeing resilient means overcoming setbacks and challenges such as losing a job, facing illness, experiencing a disaster, or grieving a loved one. These stressful events can lead people to unhealthy coping mechanisms such as substance abuse, eating disorders, or risky behaviours, which can make them feel stuck in their problems or victimized. While resilience doesn’t eliminate difficulties, it helps people look beyond them, find joy in life, and handle stress more effectively.\nThis is another opportunity for us to continue learning from EFFT. The goal is for you to have a reasonably good understanding of what validation entails by now. In this section we will develop a validation statement and add a behaviour coaching component.\n\n2.3.1 Activity: Optional Watch | The Power of Vulnerability—Brené Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 00 minutesminutes\n\n\n\nBrené Brown has spent the past two decades studying courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy at the University of Texas at Austin McCombs School of Business. Five of her books are New York Times bestsellers.\nPlease watch this video from Brown, who is well known for her work on vulnerability, shame, courage, and their relationship to resilience before starting the EFFT exercises and reading. It is likely that you have heard Brown speak before, but I encourage you to listen to her again and consider how working on shame, vulnerability, and courage can also cultivate resilience within you while working in the therapy room. This is Brown’s first TED Talk that is well known to most people; it captured the attention of the nation.\n\nThe Power of Vulnerability (2010)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter watching the video consider the following question and use it to help you process the information.\n\nHow does working on alleviating our shame build and foster resilience? Describe the connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Activity: Watch | Dan Siegel on Neurobiology and Resilience\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 00 minutesminutes\n\n\n\nThis short video by Siegel discusses how to build resilience and connection by focusing not only on the individual, but on the collective “we.”\n\nOn Neurobiology and Resilience (2015)\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Activity: Case Study\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 00 minutesminutes\n\n\n\nPlease refer back to the EFFT manual (Lafrance et al., 2020) if you need any reminders on emotion coaching or behaviour coaching.\nIn regard to stress and resilience specifically, I quote this text from our EFFT manual:\n\nThere is strong evidence to suggest that emotional intelligence (which includes emotion management, emotion perception, and emotion utilization) moderates the relationship between stress and mental health concerns in adolescents and adults, including depression, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation (Ciarrochi, Deane, & Anderson, 2002; Extremera & Fernandez-Berrocal, 2006). Taken together, these studies suggest that a focus on the development and refinement of emotion processing and regulation can serve to buffer against the experience of life stressors. For these reasons, the EFFT clinician also works with caregivers to equip them with the skills of emotion coaching to support their loved one’s wellness. Over time, their loved one develops self-efficacy with emotion processing—that is, the capacity and confidence to experience, tolerate, regulate, and be guided by their emotions without need of maladaptive coping strategies. In addition to supporting in the moment emotion processing and the development of the capacity to self-regulate, emotion-coaching skills enhance treatment in various ways. As caregivers adopt this new style of relating to their loved one, their relationship will strengthen and their efforts to support their loved one with behavioral symptoms will be more effective and better received. As symptoms decrease, caregivers can also support their loved one to manage the flood of emotions that sometimes follow. This work will also provide loved ones with evidence of their caregiver’s capacity and willingness to support them with their emotional pain, making it more likely that they will turn to the caregiver for support in times of stress. (Lafrance et al., 2020)\n\nRead the following case study and then spend some time creating a validation statement for this particular client. We will be emotion-coaching this client and adding a “behaviour intervention” that will help the client to deal with their ongoing stress in their life. You may come up with your own ideas for things that might help alleviate stress based on the class readings or your own experience, or you can also look up some suggestions if you would like. Note that you would do a lot more work than just this single emotion-coaching session before suggesting a way to cope: in real time, you really need to spend time in validation with the client, really understanding what they are saying and conveying that you “get it.”",

    "section": "3.1 Views and Approaches to Integration",
    "text": "3.1 Views and Approaches to Integration\nWe will be unpacking the five views of approaching faith and counselling that have been compiled by Eric L. Johnson, who is the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary’s Professor of Pastoral Care. Johnson received his doctorate from Michigan State University, and has written a number of books including God under Fire, and Foundations for Soul Care. In addition to writing, Johnson is also an associate editor of the Journal of Psychology and Theology, the Journal of Psychology and Christianity and the Journal of Spiritual Formation and Soul Care. In writing the collection of essays we will explore, he seeks to answer the question, “How can Christians understand and apply psychology as a discipline?” Christian leaders have been grappling with this question as they strive to balance what can sometimes seem contradictory morals and values. What is the most effective way to reconcile these two historically opposing viewpoints? In our readings we will attempt to unravel five different ways in which academics have analyzed this issue.\nIn the following learning activities you will learn more about the five approaches to integration: a levels of explanation view, an integration view, a Christian psychology view, a transformational psychology view, and a Biblical counselling approach. Although I encourage you to read Johnson’s book, for the sake of time it will not be assigned; instead we will be using and benefitting from City Vision University’s series of free lectures that unpack these five views for us. Pay attention to the start and end time provided for the YouTube clips below; you do not need to listen to the entire presentation or video, but we will focus on specific sections. The lectures are provided by Andrew Sears, PhD, and president of City Vision University, an online accredited university located in Kansas City. Consider which view resonates most with you as we walk through each of the views. We will discuss how each of the views appears in the therapy room in our next topic.\n\n3.1.1 Activity: Watch | Introduction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 00 minutesminutes\n\n\n\nWatch the following YouTube video to help introduce us to this discussion. We will discuss some of the practical reasons why it is important to explore these different approaches and why it is important to begin formulating our own ideas around this.\n\nFive Approaches to Counseling and Christianity: A Practical Guide (2021) (Watch from the beginning to 10:32)\n\nhttps://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dES1gyR8034\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter watching the video above consider the following questions:\n\nWhat is your calling? To work within more Christian environments, or secular environments? A mix of both? Who are your clients?\nWhere do each of the views tend to be taught?\nHow does Dr. Sears condense the views from five to three?\n\nTake note of the model to help you consider the implications of where you fall.\nOptional Video:\n\nSince The Bible is Sufficient for All of Life, Should We Rule Out Psychology in Counseling? (2012)\n\nTo enrich our discussion and to see an example of why it is relevant to consider these views, watch this video. Notice the “how” of the discussion and take note of the points that are being made as we dive deeper into the five approaches.\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter completing the activities above consider the following questions:\n\nWhat is the main question Dr. Sears brings up about integration? What do we need to understand at a deeper level that might be missing?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Activity: Read | Watch | Levels of Explanation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 00 minutesminutes\n\n\n\n\nLesson 2: Levels of Explanation & Christian Counselors in Secular Contexts (2021) (Watch from 1:51 to 6:20 and from 18:50 to the end)\n\nThis is a brief overview of the levels of explanation view. The levels of explanation view holds that there are many ways of looking at an issue—both psychology and theology are two of these ways. How faith and psychology intersect is that theology or faith provides a lens (and we all come to research and scientific inquiry with a lens) that colours how we interpret our findings (or even what we would like to find). It is important that we acknowledge this lens. Along with our beliefs, everyone also has a self-serving lens through which they view the world. All of these factors need to be taken into account when considering how our faith and psychology fit together.\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter completing the activity consider the following questions:\n\nWhat are some of the strengths of the model?\nWhat are some of the weaknesses?\nWhat is the dualism heresy?\n\nRead the following from Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches, pp. 23–24.\n\nCounseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (2012)\n\nThe repetition here will assist us in better understanding this approach. Feel free to skip this reading if you have a good understanding of the point of view from the video above. If you wish to take notes on this section, please refer to Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (Greggo & Sisemore, 2012) for a concise summary of this approach.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Activity: Watch | An Integration View\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 00 minutesminutes\n\n\n\n\nLesson 3: Counseling Integration Model and Christian Worldview (2021) (Watch from start to 10:56)\n\nBefore you begin to engage with this video, here is a little synopsis of what an integration view is; hopefully this will help guide your reading along with the Questions to Consider.\nThe integration view holds that we are responsible to live out our faith in all aspects of our lives and to trust in God’s divine and natural revelation to determine all of our beliefs and practices. This view does not go against science or research but holds to the idea that “all truth is God’s truth,” and God can reveal himself through natural revelation by means of scientific research. This view calls strong integrationists to really study the Word, study Christian integration, and study psychology. This video introduces the idea that the danger of integration is that many therapists don’t receive training in integration and then often become more “secularized” in the process.\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter watching the video consider the following questions:\n\nWhat are the three types of integration?\nWhat is the popular integration slogan?\nWhat are some of the strengths of the model?\nWhat are some of the weaknesses?\n\n“Integration is a recursive process of expanding understanding, but always with our most fundamental loyalty being to the true teachings of the special revelation of the Bible. Integration is ultimately the task of the Christian person whom God has led to be a student or scholar of some facet of psychology, with the true teachings of special revelation as the guiding framework for how that person structures his or her deepest beliefs and loyalties” (Johnson, 2010, p. 117).\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Activity: Read | Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches, pp. 149–178\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 00 minutesminutes\n\n\n\nIn order to fully understand this approach, we will be using repetition. Feel free to skip this reading if you have a thorough understanding of the perspective from the previous readings. You may wish to take notes on the following section in Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (Greggo & Sisemore, 2012) for a succinct summary of this approach. This very brief description will be expanded upon in the reading.\nRead pages 149–178.\n\nCounseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (2012)\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Activity: Read | A Christian Psychology View, Chapter 6, pp. 149–178\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 00 minutesminutes\n\n\n\nThe following is a short summary of a Christian psychology view. This will hopefully assist you in guiding your reading along with the Questions to Consider.\nThe Christian psychology view holds that everyone should interpret psychology from their own set of values, including Christians. So no matter what faith or non-faith perspective you hold, that will be how you interpret, research, and interact with the material (psychology or other), in front of you.\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter completing the reading above, consider the following questions:\n\nWhat is the agenda of Christian psychology?\nWhat areas of psychology are more worldview dependent?\nWhat are the major distinctives that characterize a Christian psychology worldview?\nWhat is the four-dimensional model of Christian psychology?\nWhat are some of the strengths and weaknesses of this model?\n\n“However our primary agenda in this chapter was to show the need for Christians to practice their psychology in light of their basic assumptions and the resources of their distinctive tradition. At the most comprehensive level,”tradition validity” for Christians will mean that the Christian worldview, which comes to us from the past, will enable us to meet the challenges of the present faithfully by rationally and empirically demonstrating how essential the love of Christ is for our future” (pp. 173, 174).\n\n\n\n\n3.1.6 Activity: Read | Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches, pp. 29–31\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 00 minutesminutes\n\n\n\nAs noted previously we are using repetition to really help us understand this approach. If you feel you have a good understanding of the view from the videos, feel free to skip this reading. Otherwise, read the following section in Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (Greggo & Sisemore, 2012) for a succinct summary of this approach; you may wish to take notes on this section as well.\n\nCounseling and Christianity: Five Approaches, pp. 29–31 (2012)\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.7 Activity: Read | Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches, pp. 27–29\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 00 minutesminutes\n\n\n\nWe will be using repetition here to really help us understand this approach. If you feel you have a good understanding of the view from the video, feel free to skip this reading.\nRead the following section in Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (Greggo & Sisemore, 2012) for a succinct summary of this approach; you may take notes on this section if you would like to.\n\nCounseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (2012)\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.8 Activity: Watch | A Transformational Psychology View\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 00 minutesminutes\n\n\n\nHere is a brief overview of a transformational psychology view. In the transformational psychology view, one can take wisdom from both theological and psychological viewpoints, but we need to re-evaluate what traditional psychology would tell us is appropriate psychology. Each area of study needs to be viewed through the lens of both reality and faith. Considering that this approach is based on Christian realities, this approach is only suitable for Christians. It is imperative to note that this approach has a great deal to do with the individual and how close the person is to God–the closer the person is to God, the more profound the psychology. “The bottom line will be that doing science and, in this case, psychology is ultimately an act of love” (Johnson, 2010, p. 199).\n\nLesson 5: Transformative Model: Combining Spiritual Formation and Counseling (2021)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter watching the video above, consider the following questions:\n\nWhat are some of the major themes of transformational psychology?\nWhat are the three different spiritual categories?\nTake note of the model that compares secular psychology with transformational psychology.\n\nOptional Watch:\nJohn Coe is one of the main contributors to the transformational psychology approach. In this video you can see how Coe talks about transformational psychology, particularly around the concept of spiritual formation.\n\nTalbot Talks: Spiritual Formation with Dr. John Coe (2013)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter watching the video consider the following questions:\n\nWhat is spiritual theology?\nWho is the agent of change?\nWhy has spiritual formation been misunderstood by the church, according to Coe?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.9 Activity: Watch | A Biblical Counselling Approach\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 00 minutesminutes\n\n\n\nHere is a brief overview of what a Biblical counselling approach is:\nUltimately, a Biblical counselling approach believes that the Bible and Christian faith depict humanity and behaviour in the right light. Psychological insights can be gleaned from this approach, but the Bible possesses the deepest wisdom. “Christian Ministry is a psychotherapy” (p. 245).\n\nLesson 6: Biblical Counseling Within Five Approaches to Counseling & Christianity (2021) (Watch from 00:55-10:45)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter watching the video above consider the following questions:\n\nWhat is counselling based exclusively on?\nWhat are the limitations of Biblical counselling?\nWhat are the two groups or types of Biblical counselling?\nWhat are the strengths of this approach?\n\nOptional Watch:\nDavid Powlison is one of the “big names” in the field of Biblical counselling and the Biblical approach. Watch this video to hear how he talks about how his approach differs from a “regular” counselling approach.\n\nHow Does Biblical Counseling Theory Differ from Psychotherapy? (2011)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter completing the activities above consider the following question:\n\nWhat are some similarities and some differences between a Biblical approach to counselling versus a “regular” counselling session?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.10 Activity: Read | Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches, pp. 32–34\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 00 minutesminutes\n\n\n\nAs before, if you feel you have a good understanding of the view from the video, feel free to skip this reading, or read the following section in Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (Greggo & Sisemore, 2012) for a succinct summary of this approach. You may wish to take notes on this section.\n\nCounseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (2012)\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.11 Activity: Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 00 minutesminutes\n\n\n\nTake a moment to write down in paragraph or point form some of your reactions to what you have read. Apply it to your practice.\n\nWhen you interact with your clients or in your place of work, do you see psychology and your faith as two separate entities?\n\n\nDo you feel comfortable bringing your faith into your work (when it is ethically appropriate)?\nDoes your work challenge your faith sometimes?\nDoes your faith challenge your work? At work do you place more value on science or on your faith?",

As part of this course we will read from the book Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (Greggo & Sisemore, 2012). The sections that explain how each view might apply in a therapist’s work are available to you as PDFs. The clinical case study of Jake will be incorporated into each view.\nIt is important to note before we begin that regardless of the integration approach that you choose for your own practice (if you choose one at all), as therapists it is our ethical duty to never bring up faith in the room unless the client indicates that they are interested. Critical Issues in Human Services, a course that we offer in SOCI 400, focuses on this subject. We will discuss this ethical consideration in more detail if you have not taken this course yet. As a Christian therapist or agency, we must respect the autonomy of the client (the ethical principle) and never assume that this is exactly what the client is seeking.\n\n3.2.1 Activity: Read | Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches, pp. 60–64, 72–74, and 81\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 00 minutesminutes\n\n\n\nPlease refer to the reading provided for an example of how the levels of explanation view would look in a therapy room.

    "section": "3.3 Application",
    "text": "3.3 Application\nIn this section you will begin to form your own ideas about how integration applies to your own life and your work with others. We may not spend a great deal of time discussing this area of our lives, but it can have significant implications if we do not. How do you view human nature? How do you view behaviours? What about mental health? What about research or science? What are your main values and how do you tangibly demonstrate them? As psychologists, our research and views have historically been perceived as misaligned with Christian beliefs. How do we reconcile these differences? Do you still believe this to be the case? What parts do you agree with or disagree with? If there are disagreements, why?\nHaving a framework of understanding is crucial as it informs how you present yourself and what you do. In EFFT, we have learned that when the internal experience does not match the external experience, alarm bells should sound. This is the case when you hold a certain set of values and these do not match up with the type of work you are performing. It is difficult to live with such incongruity. It is possible that we are not even aware that this is occurring.\nIn this unit and for this section, the goal is to define your values, beliefs, and how you will approach the subject. Even if you are not a Christian, everyone has their own set of values and beliefs, and it is imperative to recognize that even though you are on an ever-changing journey, these are some core beliefs you hold on to. These thoughts will be stimulated by the following activity.\n\n3.3.1 Activity: Optional Case Study\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 00 minutesminutes\n\n\n\nPlease select the viewpoint or approach that you feel most comfortable with and most drawn to for this activity. After reading the following case study, write down how you would begin to approach it. Please consider the following questions:\n\nWhat is my view of the client?\nWhat integration style will I use? How will this inform my sessions? What will I focus on?\nHow can I use EFFT in combination with my style (knowing that EFFT is an evidence-based treatment model)\n\nCase Study\n\nSandra (31) makes an appointment to speak with her therapist. She and her husband of six years have been active leaders in a thriving church ministry. Her story begins with her decision to step back from all ministry responsibilities due to ‘personal issues.’ Life is crowded with too many demands, and the timing is ripe to reassess even worthwhile commitments. Initially she is hesitant to reveal more.\nThe therapist responds by thoughtfully emphasizing how she and her husband have contributed to the discipleship of so many as the home Bible study they direct is a source of solid Christian teaching and revitalizing fellowship. He agrees to pray with her about being sensible and strategic about family priorities. After Sandra hears his perspective on her valuable contribution, her disclosure goes further. One month ago to the day, Sandra miscarried for the second time, something few people know. She admits that this is impacting her entire life as she is keeping distant from all of her former friends, all of whom have children. She is beginning to envision what her life might be if she never has a child of her own. Sandra does not imagine that people in the church have any idea of her inner anguish, and if they did, she believes that each would cease to respect her as a follower of Jesus Christ.\nSandra’s presentation flows steadily with restrained emotion until the therapist inquires gently about the impact on her marriage. She becomes tearful, sobs intermittently and has difficulty putting full sentences together. The ragged explanation reveals that the marriage tension is high and conflicts intense. The most distressing alarm is the escalating rage in the arguments between Sandra and her husband. (Greggo & Sisemore, 2012)",

It should be noted however, that you are not obligated to choose one of the views and follow it in your own journey or practice. In processing and interacting with these views the goal is to begin your own journey of thinking about integration. This will enable you to establish a belief system regarding health and wellness. To reiterate, it is not expected that you will have all these views memorized or know what distinguishes them from each other. Instead, we will begin an internal and external dialog around this topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking Your Learning\n\n\n\nBefore you move on, you may want to check that you are able to:\n\nCompare and contrast the five approaches to counselling and faith\nDiscover and determine which approach best suits each student\n\n\nUnderstand the parameters of talking about faith and spirituality in the counselling room\nDiscuss one’s own faith journey and how it relates to their future profession",

    "text": "Assignment 1: Research Paper\nInstructions\nStudents can choose to expand on the topic that they were assigned for their class presentations and add three more research articles. OR they can pick a new topic and are still required to have 3 research articles. The topic of the paper will answer the question: How would you work with someone who is struggling with ‘your assigned topic’? I invite you to use one of your case conceptualization scenarios as an illustration/case study to incorporate into this paper. The paper will cover four main points:\nAn explanation of what the topic is, how and why the topic develops, and how it shows up:\nYou are invited to use one of your case conceptualizations to illustrate your research findings.\nThe majority of the NEW research for your paper should be done in this section. This section should be the largest section in your paper.\nWhat are the preventative measures/what wellness looks like in this area:\nYou are invited to use one of your case conceptualizations in this area as a case study/example to draw on as you explore what preventative measures you would use or what wellness would look like. For example, if your character had access to these resources, what may have happened or what would wellness look like for this character?\nEvidenced based treatment directions/community resources to access:\nYou may use the information from your oral presentations here if it aligns.\nYou are also invited to once again use your case conceptualization here to describe your recommendations/treatment recommendations.\nWhat approach to therapy and integration are you drawn to and why\nYou may use your case conceptualization tool here once again to show how you would integrate your faith with this case and/or use some of your thoughts you formed from your Forum discussions.\nIf you are not a Christian, please still include this section and talk about how you would integrate your religion or worldview as we all have one regardless of our backgrounds.\nSample Thesis\nTrauma is a common mental health issue that appears in therapy and as such it is important for clinicians to be trauma-informed and therefore have a foundational knowledge of what trauma is, what the goal of therapy would be (what wellness would look like), and what evidence-based therapy approaches work effectively with trauma. This paper will begin to explore these topics and conclude with a personal reflection on the author’s approach to integration and how it relates to treating trauma.\nAssignment Criteria\nFor this assignment you will write a 10-12 page paper double spaced. This does not include your title page and reference pages.\nYour paper must include a minimum of three high-quality, academic, peer-reviewed sources (e.g., journal articles). You may also use the textbook and other good quality sources in addition, but these do not count as part of the three required sources. Research papers composed entirely of web-based research are not considered suitable as a term paper and will be graded accordingly. Use the APA Publication Manual 7th Edition as guidance for the structure of the paper, citations within the body of the paper, and construction of the reference list.\nAs per APA 7 guidelines, papers should:\nInclude a separate title page with the title of the paper, your name, student number and date along with the name of our institution (school), the course name and number. Include a separate list of references that begins on a new page (as per APA style guidelines be double-spaced with 1” margins, typed using a 12 pt. standard font (e.g., Times, Arial or Helvetica) and be left- justified.\nUse the same font throughout your paper (do not use different styles or sizes of font for title, headings, etc.). You do not need to write an abstract for this paper.\nSome Writing Tips\nFollow the APA 7 style guidelines for citing your sources in the text of your paper and formatting on your References page.\nUse quotes sparingly. For a paper of this length, 4-6 direct quotes is more than enough. Save quotes for when it is absolutely essential to preserve an author’s original wording. The paper should convey your own ‘voice’ as the author.\nAvoid paraphrasing too much. Paraphrasing can slip easily into plagiarism and also makes for a boring paper. Read this article for tips on avoiding inappropriate paraphrasing.\nWhen deciding how much of a study to describe, consider what elements of the study would persuade a reader of your point. For example, in most instances, knowing the number of subjects that were run in the study is not useful information. However, if the study is about a special subset of the population (e.g., AIDS patients), it would be useful to know if the research findings are based on results from 3 people or 30. In most instances, knowing the names of the scales that were administered is irrelevant to your point; even mentioning ALL of the surveys and results is often too much. Pick and choose the relevant aspects of the study design and findings. Don’t let your sources dictate how you write your paper. Remember your own logic or outline as you cite sources.\nGood writers are relentless revisers. Papers that have not been revised are easy to spot: they are unpolished, read like a first-draft and will never receive top marks. You will not receive an A grade without proof-reading your paper. Use spell and grammar check and it never hurts to have someone else read over your paper with a fresh set of eyes before submitting it.\nPlease include citations in your paper. This is a RESEARCH paper and as such you need to a. Demonstrate that you have done the research, b. You are not an expert in this field so you need to back up what you are saying with evidence, c. avoid plagiarism.\nDo not include references in your reference section that were not cited in your paper. This is called ‘padding your references’ and is not allowed. If there are references in your reference section that are not in your paper I will assume that you are plagiarising.",

    "text": "Assignment 2 - Oral Presentations\nInstructions\nStudents will be separated into groups of five. Each student in the group will be assigned a topic by the professor. Students will watch their fellow group members’ presentations and provide a comment or question for each. The presentations will last for 10-15 minutes and will contain information from two research articles and one community resource related to the student’s topic. All presentations must be pre-recorded and uploaded to Moodle under your group numbers by midnight on the day of our fifth class. The professor will go over how to upload videos to Moodle during Week 2 class. Presentations must be a minimum of 10 minutes and a maximum of 15, the professor will only watch a minute past the 15 minute mark. Each student will then be required to watch their fellow group members’ presentations before the start of Week 6 class. Each student will be required to write one comment OR one question on each presentation they view (4 presentations) to be completed in Moodle. The Professor will assign you one of the following topics and then you will present on one therapy modality that is used or has been developed for your topic (NOT EFFT):\n\nComplex Trauma\nAddictions\nResiliency or Stress (you can choose)\nDeath/Dying\nDepression or Eating Disorders (You can choose)\n\nMake sure that you pay attention to the weight that each section of the Rubric holds and curtail your research and your time to the sections that have the most weight.\nYou will present:\nThe research about therapy modality of choice related to your assigned topic. /9\nA bibliography must be provided in APA format and uploaded to Moodle separate from your recorded presentation. /1\nAn example of a case study (Either drawn from personal experience or from a resource). You may use the Case Conceptualization Tool from your other assignments as a guiding point for this section as well /4\nOne comment and one question for each of your groups presentations /1\nTOTAL /15\n\nAssignment 3 - Case Conceptualization\nInstructions\nEach student will need to complete 3 out of the 6 case conceptualizations. Each case conceptualization is due by the next week’s class. For example if you choose to do this week’s case conceptualization on Trauma, you will need to complete it by our next class. Please take note of the due dates on these and plan ahead which topics you would like to do. The case conceptualization form that you will need to fill out is provided at the bottom of this page; you will use the same form for all three case conceptualizations. We will go over how to complete this assignment during our first virtual class together. If you cannot attend, then a recording of our class will be uploaded to Moodle for your viewing convenience. I would recommend that you choose your case conceptualizations based on which topics you are most interested in. Students will have the opportunity to use these case conceptualizations for their other assignments.\nSpend the most time focusing on the observations and impressions section of this form. (The other sections shouldn’t take long to fill out). In the Observations and Impressions section I need to see evidence that you are connecting what you are learning to what you have watched- we are practicing the application of our learning through this exercise. As always, look at the grading rubric to see how items are weighted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatching these movies can be triggering and so I encourage you to choose the topics that will be less triggering for you.\n\n\n\nThe 6 Movie Titles are:\n\nTrauma: I Can Only Imagine (2018)\nAddictions: Beautiful Boy (2018)\nDeath/Dying: The Descendents (2011)\nMental Health Issues: Ordinary People (1980)\nResilience/Stress: Wonder (2017)\nIntegration: Miracles From Heaven (2016)\n\nGrading Rubric\nIs the Demographics section filled out correctly? /1\nReason for referral /1\nBackground information demonstrates that you watched the movie /2\nObservations and Impressions: connecting the movie to what you have learned /4\nTreatment recommendations /2\nTOTAL: /10",

    "text": "Assignment 4 - Forum Discussions\nInstructions\nStudents will post a reply to the weekly question posted on the forum page that shows evidence of having read the course material. Students will also be required to ask a question or make a comment on 2 other students’ forum posts to facilitate discussion.\nForum posts need to be completed by the Tuesday following class and the opportunity to post to the forum will be cut off at the start of our next class. Forum posts are about engaging in discussion and late forum posts are not meeting this requirement. I will speak more about this in class. If a post is late, I will not be marking it. Only 5 out of the 6 forums will be marked. You can choose to skip a week, or at the end I will take the 5 highest marks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant: Discussions are an important part of this online course. Most discussion postings should be no more than 250 words. You are also asked to read your fellow learner’s postings and then respond to at least two other people. All postings should be carefully written and edited before being posted. Opinions should be well supported. Your responses should also be communicated in professional language, respectful of others, and to the point. Forum posts are personal reflections that synthesize the information you have learned with your own experiences. You are not allowed to use AI for forum posts.\n\n\n\n\nGrading Rubric\nYour assignment will be graded according to the following criteria:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriteria\n4-5 marks\n2-3 marks\n0-1 marks\n\n\n\n\nQuality of posting\nSound evidence that student has done course readings and has a thorough knowledge of discussion topic\nEvidence that most of course readings done and student has some knowledge of discussion topic\nMinor evidence that course readings were done and student understands discussion topic\n\n\nCommunication skills\nPostings are clear, concise and easy to understand\nPostings are usually, but not always clear, concise and easy to understand\nPostings are too short/long and/or unclear and hard to understand\n\n\nCritical thinking and self-reflection\nExceptionally well- supported, thoughtful, insightful comments made on others’ and own postings\nSome evidence of critical thought and self-reflection on others’ and own postings\nMinor evidence of critical thought and reflection on others’ and own postings\n\n\nParticipation\nRegularly participates in, and facilitates interaction among members of online community\nInteracts now and then with other members of online community\nRarely interacts or responds to other members of online community\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal /20\n\n\n\n\n\nTrauma and EFFT\nBased on what we learned about the trauma brain in this unit, how would EFFT be a good treatment option? How would emotion coaching specifically (and the science behind it) be beneficial?\nPerceptions of Addiction\nBefore this unit, how did you perceive someone with an addiction, and how has your perspective changed (if anything)?\nBlock Work and Validation Exercise\nAfter completing the EFFT exercises for this week, share with the group your experience of the block work and the validation of silence exercise. Do you see this as beneficial? What would you struggle with in regards to doing this with a client?\nWhat is Your Biggest Block?\nWe have read about clinician blocks in our EFFT manual (go back and refresh yourself if you need to). What do you think your biggest block would be in regards to working with mental health issues? Pick one of the three topics that we have discussed in this unit. What is the block and how would you go about addressing the block for yourself?\nResilience and Stress\nHow are resilience and stress related? In your life, do you find yourself feeling more resilient in some stressful situations versus others? Why do you think that is?\nPsychology and Faith\n\n“How do you reconcile your commitment to psychological science with your commitment to the Christian faith? 1. How do they fit together? 2. Are they mutually supportive? 3. Are there points of tension?” (Johnson, 2010, p. 49)",
