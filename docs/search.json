In order to equip you to think truthfully, act justly, and live faithfully for the good of the world and the glory of God, we know that you must grow in your ability to engage in geunine critical thinking, generate original work, and express your own ideas in an organized and clear manner. Quite simply, generative AI tools can shortcut that process. We urge you to avoid thinking of your education as transactional (produce something, get a grade, get a degree) and instead consider it as transformational (helping you to become a better human being).\nAt the same time, we also understand that we are preparing you for a life and career after graduation wherein the use of generative AI tools will become more commonplace. To that end, we hope to guide you toward its use in ethical ways that do not shortcut the overall purpose of your education but rather enhance it.\nYour responsibility is to ensure that you understand the ethical and legal issues inherent in the use of these tools, avoid the use of any tool that shortcuts the learning process, and pay close attention to the expectations that each of your professors has based on the learning outcomes for each course that you take at TWU.

    "text": "Welcome to Psych 339! I am excited to begin all of the topics and units that we have planned for the following weeks. There will be a lot of information coming at you, especially in the beginning units, but in later units, we will review and refer back to the information, so my hope is that it won’t feel like too much of an overload.\nI would like to take the time here to review a couple of things that may help you navigate your way through this information.\n\nAssignments\nThe grading portion of classes can be an anxiety-provoking focus and so I thought I would give you all a couple of tips.\n\nAll of the questions for the quiz will be taken from the “Questions to Consider” sections in the units. The quiz is open-book and so if you write down the answers as you go through the material, you will have all of the answers at your fingertips when it comes time to take the quiz.\nYou are only required to do three of the six case conceptualizations. I would recommend that you choose the case conceptualizations or topics that you are most interested in, as you will be choosing one of them and writing your final paper on it. We will discuss more about this in class.\nOral presentations: You will be placed in groups and assigned a topic—you can also use the information gathered in this assignment to help you write your final paper. You will be required to research and present on one treatment or therapy model known to be effective for the mental health issue you have been assigned.\nThe Discussions should be answered every week. I will not grade comments that are submitted late as you will have missed out on the discussion and participation portion. One free pass is given; if you complete all of the Forum discussion questions then I will use your five best marks for the grade.\nThe final paper is a research paper and should be written as such. We will discuss what is required and how to briefly write a research paper in class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: The Learning Activities in this course are ungraded unless specified. They are designed to help you succeed in your assessments in the course, so you are strongly encouraged to complete them.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterconnectedness of the Material\nAll of the topics that we will be learning about can affect each other, especially trauma, which can be at the root of almost every mental health issue—that is why we are starting with it first. I have not included it in our first unit, but I invite you to watch Gabor Mate’s film The Wisdom of Trauma. It is a very meaningful and informative film on the effects of trauma. I also encourage you not to view each unit as a separate unit, but as building upon and being a continuation from each other.\n\n\nResearch Articles\nI have included a smattering of research articles throughout our learnings together. These are the types of articles I would like you to find for your research papers. Research articles must be peer-reviewed and from a reputable source. Research articles, unlike textbooks, often focus on one specific aspect or finding related to the subject. Notice how they provide an overview of the subject in their introductions, and then focus their research specifically on the question they are trying to answer.\n\n\nA Note on Emotion-Focused Family Therapy\nThere are some interventions in the emotion-focused family therapy (EFFT) course resource that we will not be including, as to do so would require target training as well as following the requirement to be a registered therapist with a Master’s degree. However I still invite you to read about clinician chair block work and caregiver chair block work as well as therapeutic apologies, as it is very impactful work.\nWe will be reviewing the EFFT exercises assigned in each class.\nI look forward to our learnings together and hope and pray that this class will be an enriching and helpful experience.",

    "section": "1.1 What is Trauma?",
    "text": "1.1 What is Trauma?\nThis first unit will lead you to explore some of the research on trauma. Topic 1 will help you not only gain a basic understanding of the varying types of trauma and how to define them, but also identify the main researchers in the field. Learning about the prominent researchers in this field will give you a good foundation and direction to fall back on as you go further in your studies, and as you encounter trauma in your day-to-day activities.\nThe resources provided for this topic will discuss the areas of the brain trauma affects and how it differs from stress. Dr. Bessel van der Kolk’s famous book The Body Keeps the Score (2015) will also be discussed, and we will conclude this section with some definitions and key terms you should know.\n\nTrauma\nTrauma is a very difficult mental health issue to work with. A trauma is a painful, confusing, intergenerational, illogical, interfering, irrational, and shocking experience. The treatment of trauma requires more than a series of four to five sessions; it can be a lengthy and complex process with advances and setbacks.\nA trauma can manifest itself in many different ways. Dr. Joseph Spinazzola and Dr. Bessel van der Kolk are prominent researchers in the field of trauma and emphasize that it is not the traumatic incident that remains with people and affects them, but rather unprocessed emotions and going through trauma alone that remains with them. This is also emphasized by Dr. Adele LaFrance, the co-creator of emotionally-focused family therapy (EFFT).\nThe culture of our society is so geared toward avoiding pain at any cost that when it does emerge we attempt to shut it down and conceal it before it causes too much damage. It is in the avoidance of pain, in the avoidance of the traumatic event, that darkness and maladaptive coping skills emerge, which are often what bring people into therapy.\nIn the course of working with trauma as therapists, we have the tendency to desire a quick fix or to avoid entering into the dark pit of pain. It can be difficult to navigate this fine line between going too far and experiencing secondary trauma, and avoiding feeling the pain with our clients. As a consequence, we would like to warn you that some of the stories and case studies we will be discussing in this course may be triggering or difficult to listen to. Take note of your ability to engage with the material as the intention is not to create dysregulation within you.\n\n\n1.1.1 Activity: What is Trauma?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the following videos and listen to Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, one of the most prominent trauma researchers, then answer the following questions. You may want to watch the first video more than once since a lot of information is packed into a short timeframe.\n\nWhat is Trauma? The Author of “The Body Keeps the Score” Explains (2021)\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Ways Trauma Can Change the Brain (2014)\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYou will be able to check your understanding of the topic by considering these questions.\n\nWhat is the difference between stress and trauma?\nHow does van der Kolk define trauma?\nWhy does it make a difference whether or not PTSD develops if a caregiver or parent is there for us after a traumatic event occurs?\nWhat does van der Kolk name as the primitive/survival part of the brain?\nWhat emotions do traumatized people have trouble experiencing?\nWhat are the three areas that are affected in those who have experienced childhood trauma?\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Activity: Reading | The Body Keeps the Score, Prologue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReading the prologue to Dr. van der Kolk’s book will provide you a good introduction to trauma and to his experience and work with it.\n\nThe Body Keeps the Score, Prologue (2015)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYou will be able to check your understanding of the topic by considering these questions.\n\nWhat are some examples of how trauma affects not only the individual, but also those around the individual?\nWhat types of physiological change does trauma reproduce?\nWhat are the three approaches used in helping heal traumatized individuals?\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Activity: Optional Reading | The Body Keeps the Score, Chapter 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you plan to work with traumatized individuals, Chapter 3 in The Body Keeps the Score is an excellent suggested resource for you.\n\nThe Body Keeps the Score, Chapter 3 (2015) Highlights from the reading are described in the following paragraphs (van der Kolk, 2015):\n\nOne of the main findings in a study that was conducted by examining the brain with MRI is that trauma is preverbal. While undergoing brain scans, research participants were simultaneously triggered with reminders of their individual traumas. Through this experiment it was discovered that Broca’s area in the brain (where speech resides) was shut down, or dark on the MRI. This is a major finding as it tells us that the connection between speech and what is happening is disconnected. Similarly, it was shown that when something happens to remind traumatized people of their trauma, their right brain responds as if the event was happening in the present, while their left side of the brain is shut down, which can block the realization that the event is not happening in real time. This is all experienced in the bodily-felt sense. This therefore means that the experience of trauma itself can get in the way of talking about the trauma. This piece of information is crucial to know as therapists, because the process of change in the therapy room often involves talking.\nvan der Kolk also describes trauma succinctly in this chapter. He describes trauma as something that happens to you that makes you so upset that it overwhelms you and there is nothing you can do to help yourself function in the face of the particular event. Trauma is how you respond to it.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Activity: A Note on Childhood Trauma and Adverse Childhood Experiences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two sections to this activity. In the first, Dr. van der Kolk explains how trauma manifests in children, and in the second, pediatrician Nadine Burke Harris shares during a TED Talk the importance of acknowledging childhood trauma and how it impacts our physical well-being.\n\nBessel van der Kolk on the Treatment of Trauma: How Childhood Trauma is Different from PTSD (2013)\n\n\n\n\nPediatrician Nadine Burke Harris explains that the repeated stress of abuse, neglect, and parents struggling with mental health or substance abuse issues has real, tangible effects on the development of the brain. Watch the following video:\n\nHow Childhood Trauma Affects Health Across a Lifetime (2015)\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYou will be able to check your understanding of the topic by considering these questions.\n\nHow does PTSD manifest in children?\nWhat areas of the brain does trauma affect?\nWhy are children more sensitive to brain change from trauma?\n\nTo gain a better understanding of your own past experiences, you can take the following short adverse childhood experience (ACE) quiz found on the website below. It is important to note that participation in this activity is not mandatory, nor will you be asked to share your experiences. Please proceed with caution and awareness as the questions and discoveries may be triggering.\n\nTake Your ACE Test (n.d.)\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.5 Activity: Terminology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis activity will introduce you to some of the concepts and terminology used in this field by looking up the following terms. The website given here is recommended for searching the terms listed in the tool below. By doing the search yourself you are more likely to remember the definitions. Try to write out or type out the definitions instead of just copying and pasting them. This section aims to define these terms at the end of the section rather than at the beginning so you will recognize some of them and have a context from the resources you have read.\n\nComplex Trauma Resources (n.d.)\n\nUse the tool below to assist you in this activity. Please note that if you close or refresh the page your work will be lost, so you may wish to download the file with your answers before closing the browser.",

    "section": "1.2 Why and How Does Trauma Happen?",
    "text": "1.2 Why and How Does Trauma Happen?\nTo develop a preliminary understanding of why trauma occurs, you have learned defining terms in the previous topic. This topic will focus on why and how PTSD develops and persists—we often tend to focus on the “why” of abuse; however PTSD is not something to discuss in the beginning. The learning activities included in this topic will allow you to explore the reasons why the brain and body can perceive an event as if it were happening right now, even when an event or series of events occurred in the past. Furthermore, the resources will discuss what happens to our brains when trauma occurs and persists over time. Despite some repetition in the resources, the expectation is that you will retain more of the information by digesting it through various sources and formats.\n\n1.2.1 Activity: Reading | The Body Keeps the Score, Chapter 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite being potentially overwhelming, this chapter is extremely informative regarding what happens to the brain when trauma occurs. Please use the following questions to guide your reading, as they will assist you in focusing on the most important information.\n\nWatch What is trauma? The author of “The Body Keeps the Score” explains | Bessel van der Kolk | Big Think(2021).\n\n\n\n\n\nRead The Body Keeps the Score, Chapter 4 (2015)\n\n\n“When you can’t be fully here, you go to the places where you did feel alive—even if those places are filled with horror and misery” (van der Kolk, 2015, p. 73).\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYou will be able to check your understanding of the topic by considering the following questions.\n\nWhat happens to the brain when the normal response is blocked?\nWhat are the five things our brains need to do in order to ensure our survival?\nWhat does “neurons that fire together, wire together” mean?\nWhat are frontal lobes responsible for?\nWhat are mirror neurons?\nWhat is the difference between top-down regulation and bottom-up regulation?\nWhy can flashbacks and reliving trauma almost be worse than experiencing the trauma?\nWhat parts of the brain need to be “online” in order to visit past traumatic memories?\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Activity: Reading | In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts, Chapters 17 and 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGabor Maté’s book, In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts (2010), focuses on addiction. You may want to spend some time reading Chapters 17 and 18 to better understand how addiction and trauma are intertwined.\nMaté is famous for saying, “don’t ask why the addiction, but why the pain.” He would state that every person who has an addiction has experienced trauma (Mate, 2010). Thus, we will read a few chapters from the book that describe how the brain develops and works. Observe how Maté describes both physical trauma and emotional trauma. The need for strong attachment figures from a young age has been discussed and will continue to be discussed—this section explains the effects on the brain and brain development. Our next unit on addiction will benefit from investigating the effects on the brain.\n\nIn the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters With Addiction (2010)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYou will be able to check your understanding of the topic by considering the following questions.\n\nHow much smaller do mistreated children’s brains tend to be?\nWhat part of the brain tends to be smaller in trauma survivors? What is this part of the brain responsible for?\nWhat is the stress hormone called?\nWhat does early stress establish in a child?\nHow does early abuse and neglect affect interpersonal relationships?\nWhat are three universal factors that lead to stress?\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Activity: Optional Website Reading | The Effects of Complex Trauma on Brain Development\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplextrauma.org is an excellent website to familiarize yourself with for research and information about trauma, as well as for resources and opportunities. In addition to using this site to define some terms, I invite you to read the following explanation of the impact trauma has on the brain. Hopefully, some of this information will sound familiar to you.\n\nThe Effects of Complex Trauma on Brain Development (n.d.)\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Activity: Optional Reading | Treating Adult Survivors of Childhood Emotional Abuse and Neglect, pp. 3–12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiterature in this section discusses emotional abuse or neglect and psychological trauma. Emotional and psychological trauma is a relatively new and complex area of trauma study, and it is crucial that we learn how this affects the systems in which we live, work, and commune. As you read this section, keep the authors’ working definition of complex trauma in the back of your mind—they identify complex trauma as defined by Courtois (2004) and Courtois & Ford, (2010, as cited in Hopper et al., 2021):\n“Courtois (2004) articulated … complex trauma as a recurrent and escalating form of trauma, occurring primarily within familial or intimate relationships … requiring survival to take precedence over normal psychobiological development” (Courtois & Ford, 2010, as cited in Hopper et al., 2021, p. 9).\nAdditionally, they note that the Complex Trauma Workgroup has a similarly developmentally anchored definition of complex trauma as “a dualistic, pernicious, and progressive relationship between exposure and adaptation” (as cited in Hopper et al., 2021, p. 9).\n\nRead pages 3 to 12 in Treating Adult Survivors of Childhood Emotional Abuse and Neglect: Component-Based Psychotherapy (2021)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYou will be able to check your understanding of the topic by considering the following questions.\n\nCan you describe the difference between emotional abuse versus emotional neglect?\nWhy does psychological maltreatment in the home still largely remain in a gray area? What factors make it hard to identify or intervene?\nWhat is psychological abuse the strongest predictor of?\nHow does Courtois (2004) define complex trauma?\nWhat is the difference between Type I trauma and Type II trauma?\nWhat do the acronyms PTSD, CPTSD, and DTD stand for?",

    "text": "1.3 How Do We Work With Trauma?\nDuring this topic you will become familiar with and comfortable with one main therapeutic approach. The purpose is to give you some practical skills and applications, rather than just a variety of theories that you would need to study further in order to implement. Consequently, this topic may feel more overwhelming, due to the repetition of the same information with a slightly different application. In this section, we will begin by learning about emotion-focused family therapy (EFFT) and then we will apply it specifically to the treatment of trauma.\nThere are many therapy modalities that are specifically designed for trauma; EFFT is an all-encompassing modality and not trauma-specific. In the final activity you will be provided with a list of trauma-informed therapies that you can pursue at your own leisure. If you come into contact with someone who has complex trauma or PTSD at this stage of your studies, it is best to refer them to someone who is qualified and trained to work with PTSD.\n\nIn our view, successful complex trauma intervention in real-life practice—particularly when conducted with adult survivors of the kind of pervasive and profound deprivation and debasement that comes from living through chronic and severe emotional abuse and neglect in childhood—can almost never be accomplished through adoption of a singular clinical target, follow a consistently linear process, or result from adherence to one specific clinical technique. In contrast, it is tangled, precarious work, work that is predictable in its unpredictability, that inevitably requires the therapists’ extensive use of themselves in the treatment process and that simultaneously demands attention to the body and all that usually goes unspoken in trauma and psychotherapy. (Hopper et al., 2021, pp. 14–15)\n\n\n1.3.1 Activity: Optional Reading | Treating Adult Survivors of Childhood Emotional Abuse and Neglect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the following article for a description of a new framework for treating childhood emotional abuse and neglect. This article describes component-based psychotherapy. This is not an essential therapy for you to know as we will be focusing on learning about emotionally-focused family therapy in our time together, but if you are interested in working with trauma or have done so previously, I would recommend reading this article.\n\nTreating Adult Survivors of Childhood Emotional Abuse and Neglect (2021)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYou will be able to check your understanding of the topic by considering the following questions.\n\nWhat are the three predominant paradigms that have emerged regarding traumatic stress inquiry and research?\nWhat does CBP stand for? What are some preliminary characteristics of the model?\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Activity: Optional Reading | Complex Trauma and the Christian Context\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn adult with complex trauma history frequently experiences disrupted systems of meaning, which can lead to adversely affected belief systems. The experiences of shame, betrayal, meaning-making, and mourning experienced by adult survivors of childhood trauma often complicate their spiritual or religious beliefs. The goal of this activity is to provide you with a better understanding of how a complex trauma treatment is applied within a Christian context.\n\nBeyond Survival: Application of a Complex Trauma Treatment Model in the Christian Context (2015)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYou will be able to check your understanding of the topic by considering the following questions.\n\nWhy is it vital for a therapist to “know thyself” as this article highlights? How can a therapist’s own religion or faith get in the way of trauma therapy?\nWhat is the importance of relational rupture and repair? What are the reasons for allowing therapeutic ruptures to occur?\nWhy is the skill of validation important?\nWhy would it be beneficial to explore a client’s view of God and God’s view of themselves?\nWhat is MBCT and how can it be beneficial?\nWhy is it easy in a Christian environment to confuse dysregulated behaviour with willful sin?\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Activity: Reading | Emotion-Focused Family Therapy, pp. 3–48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead pages 3–48 in your course resource below. The purpose of this unit is to process this new model and make our own deductions regarding how this model may be applied to the treatment of trauma.\n\nEmotion-Focused Family Therapy: A Transdiagnostic Model for Caregiver-Focused Interventions (2020)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYou will be able to check your understanding of the topic by considering the following questions.\n\nWhat is EFFT?\nWhat are the core principles of EFFT?\nWhat are advanced caregiving skills?\nWhat are the six pillars of EFFT?\nWhat are some of the themes that research of EFFT has shown?\nWhat areas does the bridge responsible for emotion regulation connect? (which parts of the brain?)\nWhat are some of the benefits of emotion coaching?\nWhat happens over time when emotion coaching is present?\nWhat is a super feeler?\nWhat are the five steps of emotion coaching?\nWhat is the two-step model of emotion coaching?\nWhat is the “good house–bad house” metaphor?\n\n\n\n\nWhen you come from a place where you were not allowed to know what you know or feel what you feel, it can be extraordinarily difficult to find a language for yourself and your inner experience. The presence of a compassionate, safe, and reflective therapist is essential to help you discover who you are and what is going on inside. This is never an easy process, and the main task of the therapist is to create physiological stability and the necessary safety to activate the “watchtower of the mind” (van der Kolk, 2014), where we can compassionately observe ourselves and examine our warring fears, longings and impulses. (Hopper et al., 2021, xiii)\n\nThe chapters of our EFFT resource contain a great deal of information to process and absorb. As a result, we will not spend much time applying specific interventions to trauma scenarios in this section.\nPlease do your own application in the case study below, as well as the corresponding Forum Discussion question. The case study provides an opportunity for you to practice the skill of validation. Don’t worry if this seems confusing. This scenario will be discussed in class. Also consider how this model could be applied to trauma work theoretically. We will work on specific interventions in future units.\n\n\n1.3.4 Activity: Optional Exploration | Trauma-Informed Therapies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook up the following modalities to see what types of treatment options are available and notice which modalities resonate with you and why. These modalities do not require in-depth knowledge. Again, the aim is to provide you with a foundation so that when you encounter trauma in your work environment, you will already know which modality resonates with you and in which you would benefit from further training.\n\nEMDR Therapy: Demonstration & Step-by-Step Walkthrough (2021)\nNarrative Exposure Therapy (NET) (2025)\nOrigin of Somatic Experiencing (2012)\nInternal Family Systems & CBP & AEDP & STAIR/MPE (n.d.)\nARC Therapy (n.d.)\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.5 Activity: Case Study\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake note of the following questions as you read the case study below.

During the previous unit, we have been able to gain a strong understanding of how trauma affects the brain. This knowledge will complement our studies this week, as Gabor Mate famously said, “Don’t ask why the addiction, ask why the pain.”\nTrauma is heavily connected to the development and maintenance of addictions and we will spend this unit exploring this connection further.\nIt is important to note that this can be a very difficult and emotional topic to explore depending on your own personal history and that of those who are close to you. Throughout this learning process, I encourage you to take care of yourself if this topic is triggering for you. If necessary, take breaks, make sure you have ample time before and after you study the information, or schedule an appointment with a therapist or a friend in order to process some of what you encounter.",

    "section": "2.1 What is Addiction?",
    "text": "2.1 What is Addiction?\nAn addiction is a chronic brain disorder with reward, motivation, and memory components. Basically, it refers to a tendency to seek a reward in a compulsive or obsessive manner without taking into account consequences. This is just one definition of addiction; you will probably encounter others.\nIn the long term, addiction can significantly interfere with a person’s daily activities. Those who suffer from addiction may also experience cycles of relapse and remission. It is therefore possible for them to cycle between intensified and mild usage. Over time, addictions often worsen despite these cycles. These types of problems can cause permanent health complications as well as having serious consequences such as bankruptcy, alienation from family, and rejection by society.\nThere are a wide variety of resources available on the topic of addiction; they describe types of addiction, triggers, the signs and causes of addiction, as well as stages of addiction and their complications.\nThere are many definitions of addiction available online. Through the Learning Activities in this unit we will explore some of the most important terms in this field, as well as hear from some of the leading researchers.\n\n2.1.1 Activity: Reading | In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts, pp. 1–3 and Chapters 11–16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts, pp. 1–3, and Chapters 11–16 (2010)\n\nGabor Maté’s book In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts is a very important and valuable course resource. Given the time available for this course, it is recommended that you complete specific readings, but the book as a whole is very valuable.\nThe chapters are quite substantial in and of themselves so it is strongly recommended that you follow along with the questions provided below as you read; as a result, you will be able to retain more information.\nAdditionally, before you complete this reading take a moment to consider your own definition of addictions and what automatic thoughts or assumptions you have about people struggling with addictions.\nQuestions to Consider\nYou will be able to check your understanding of the topic by considering these questions.\n\nWhat is our present-day definition of addiction?\nWhat are the four components of addiction? (Maté, p. 129)\nWhy do all addictions also have a biological dimension to them?\nWhy is it unhelpful to view addiction as a disease?\nWhat did the study done with Vietnam War veterans show?\nWhat is the significance of “Rat Park”?\nWhat three factors need to coincide in order for a substance addiction to develop?\nWhat does it mean to have a diminished amount of dopamine receptors in the brain? Why would someone with a smaller number of dopamine receptors be at higher risk for addiction?\nWhat are the short-term effects of drugs on the brain and what are the long-term effects?\nTake note of the story of Claire at the end of Chapter 16 and how her story is described using the information that we have recently learned.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Activity: Watch | A Visual Portrayal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease take a moment to watch the following video. Please be aware that this video may evoke some strong emotions.\n\nNuggets (2014)\n\n\n\n\nJournal Record\nAfter watching the video, use the following link to record your thoughts. Note that your responses will not be saved once you close the active browser, so you will need to save or download your document before closing it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Activity: Key Terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a moment to read some of the terms below. The purpose of reviewing specific definitions is to reinforce the information presented in this topic.\n\nTolerance: decreased reaction to a process or substance after repeated use. Increasing uptake may only increase tolerance.\nRelationship between opioids and oxytocin: oxytocin helps us to not become tolerant to our own natural opiates. When endorphins lock onto opiate receptors they trigger the chemistry of love and connection, helping us be the social creatures we are.\nDopamine receptors: a decreased presence of these is correlated with a greater uptake of substances or addictive behaviours.\nDopamine system: most active during the initiation and establishment of drug intake and other addictive behaviours and is key in reinforcing patterns of all drugs of abuse.\nOpiates: these don’t take away pain, but reduce our consciousness of it as unpleasant stimuli. They are responsible for the pleasure–reward aspects of addiction.\nReinforcement: the triggering of VTA (ventral tegmental apparatus) activation and dopamine release in the NA (nucleus accumbens)\nPrefrontal cortex: responsible for the impulse control center, executive functioning, and is where social behaviours are learned. This becomes impaired in an addicted brain.\nOrbitofrontal cortex: decision-making, inhibiting impulses, initiating cravings, and balancing short-term objectives against longer-term consequences in the process of decision making. Images show that the OFC works abnormally in drug users.\nSalience attribution: the assignment of great value to a false need and the depreciation of true ones.\nEpigenetics: effects are most powerful in early development, the ability for genes to turn on and off based on environmental factors. “As a result of life events, chemicals attach themselves to DNA and direct gene activities” Maté (2010, p. 204).\nGene expression: how a gene acts.\nProcess addictions or behaviour addictions: gambling, shopping, food, love, sex, internet, dangerous activities, thrill-seeking activities, pornography\nSubstance addictions: alcohol, drugs, pain pills, tobacco\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Activity: Optional Reading | A Biblical Reflection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Deuteronomy 4: 15–16, Isaiah 44: 9, and Colossians 3: 5\n\nThe Bible talks about how an idol is anything that takes priority over our ability and willingness to worship and serve God. An idol can “replace” God in our lives, and our relationship with whatever we have made an idol in our lives becomes more important than our relationship with God. An addiction could be considered an idol, as when one is in the midst of an addiction it becomes the sole priority and as we have read, even one’s basic health may be pushed aside for the sake of engaging in the addiction.\nIn addition, we have read that the same neural pathways in the brain are involved in addictions and attachments. According to Genesis 2: 18–23, we were created for attachment. As we have discussed previously, addiction can fill a hole inside of us when we lack the type of attachment that God intended, the secure base that allows us to fail and be okay. This is especially true for people who are trying to numb or eliminate intolerable pain.\nConsider how far our world has fallen from God’s intended design for us and how far we have fallen from that design. How does this context affect your perception of those suffering from addiction? Does it make a difference?",

    "section": "2.2 How and Why Does Addiction Develop?",
    "text": "2.2 How and Why Does Addiction Develop?\nAmong the most common causes of addiction development mentioned in the literature are chronic stress, trauma, mental illness, and a family history of addiction. Researchers are still uncertain what causes addiction, or how it develops as risks vary from person to person.\nThe purpose of this section is to discuss the six basic theories of addiction, followed by an analysis of Gabor Maté’s analysis of how and why addiction develops. To conclude, we will examine some brain scans of addicted individuals and discuss the various categories of addiction that can be identified by such brain scans.\n\n2.2.1 Activity: Website | Six Fundamental Theories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGabor Maté’s work with and view of addiction, and how and why it forms, is a biopsychosocial one. This view is supported by the most recent research and brain science, so we are focusing primarily on it. To better understand how and why addiction develops, it is worthwhile to examine other theories.\nTake a look at the following presentation that discusses five different theories.\n\nTheories of Addiction (n.d.)\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Activity: Reading | In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts, Chapters 17–19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section we will explore the reasons and mechanisms behind addiction. You will continue reading In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts through Chapter 19 in order to gain further insight into addiction and how it manifests in the brain. You have already read Chapters 17 and 18 during the last unit. You can take this opportunity to review the information, or read only Chapter 19 if you feel that you have a good understanding of the information.\n\nIn the Realm of Hungry Ghosts, Chapters 17–19 (2010)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nYou will be able to check your understanding of the topic by considering these questions.\n\nWhat is epigenetics and what is its significance?\nWhat can we focus on with regard to prevention?\nAt what stage can one already begin to have a predisposition to alcohol “programmed” in them?\nWhen and where are the numbers of and density of dopamine receptors determined?\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Activity: Optional Website Exploration | Brain Imaging with Dr. Amen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the Amen Clinics website, you will find information on addiction and how the Amen Clinics use brain imaging to identify types of addiction. Although this presentation of addiction is based on a medical model rather than a therapeutic model, it is valuable information nonetheless. (Scroll down through the webpage to see additional links or information—sometimes it seems as though there is no additional information to be reviewed, but there is more if you continue.)\nVisit the link below to learn more about brain imaging for this activity.\n\nDrugs and Alcohol Addiction (n.d.)",

    "section": "2.3 Working with Addictions",
    "text": "2.3 Working with Addictions\nIt may be difficult for individuals who have been affected by addiction for a considerable amount of time to determine moral leanings, personal boundaries, and what kinds of behaviours are normative, rather than simply performative and survival-based. Public policy and literature increasingly recognizes that addiction is a maladaptive response to trauma. It is estimated that approximately two-thirds of those seeking treatment for alcohol and substance abuse issues have been affected by trauma. There is no doubt that addiction is extremely difficult to navigate and overcome, and not everyone is able to succeed for long periods of time.\nAddiction is a complex issue that can be addressed with many theories and models, but EFFT remains the main approach and theory that will be discussed in this unit. During the following Learning Activities you will learn about Gabor Maté’s insights into the healing process and what he calls “compassionate inquiry,” which pairs nicely with EFFT. Through compassionate inquiry, the client gains an understanding of how the unconscious dynamics in their lives can be released.\n\n2.3.1 Activity: Reading | In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts, Chapters 29–33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to develop a healthy brain two realms must be considered: the external world—environment and support—as well as the internal world, your own self-awareness and ability to be mindful. In reading the following chapters we will explore the concept of wellness and sobriety (versus abstinence), as well as how to maintain both. Take note of the correlations with EFFT principles as you read chapters 29 to 33.\n\nIn the Realm of Hungry Ghosts, Chapters 29–33 (2010)\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Activity: Reading | Emotion-Focused Family Therapy, Chapters 2–3 and pp. 153–154\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Chapter 19 in Maté’s book (2010), there are many things that one cannot control, such as genetic makeup, temperament, where one is born, and so on. Thus, it is important to focus on things that can be controlled.\nTwo of these areas are highlighted by EFFT: family environment and emotional processing. The diagram below provides a good visual of this; it was created by Adele LaFrance and Natasha Files (2018) for presentation purposes.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Two Areas Highlighted by EFFT in Mental Health\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource:  by Jasmine Pang.\nAs we learned in our previous unit, Maté also emphasizes the importance of caregivers and community in the recovery process, which fits well with the EFFT model that emphasizes parental and caregiver involvement in mental health issues. Family environment and emotional processing are the two areas we can “control” and if we work on both, the healing process will be extremely powerful.\nNote: During class you will be doing an activity that revolves around the skill of emotion coaching and validation, so make sure you read Chapters 2 and 3 in Lafrance et al. (2020).\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Activity: Video | Visual of Emotion Coaching\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn excellent illustration of what EFFT emotion coaching aims to accomplish is Dr. Siegel’s hand model. The purpose of emotion coaching is to build a bridge between the prefrontal cortex and the limbic system over time. Siegel’s hand metaphor can be a very effective way to explain the concept not only to parents, as in the video, but also to our clients.\nWatch the following video:\n\nDr. Daniel Siegel Presenting a Hand Model of the Brain (2012)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Activity: Reflect | Looking Back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to do the reflection for this activity go back and read the first chapter of In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts (Mate, 2010). Take in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside as Maté describes it.\n\nIn the Realm of Hungry Ghosts, Chapter 1 (2010)\n\nReflect:\n\nWhat comes up for you?\nIn comparison to your previous attitude toward this area of the city and its residents, do you feel any different now?\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.5 Activity: Validation Exercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this activity read Chapter 4 of In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts. You will practice how to write a proper validation statement to explain why Serena has been using and continues to use, or if you prefer, you can write a validation statement to explain her inability to see her own inner strength and innate perfection. You may think these will sound too scripted or even strange, but this is an integral part of the learning process.\n\nIn the Realm of Hungry Ghosts, Chapter 4 (2010) This exercise can be broken down into two steps:\n\n\nTo begin, your statement might look something like this:\n\n\n“No wonder/It makes sense why you continue to use because … because … because …”\n\nor\n\n“It makes sense to me why you would be struggling with seeing your own inner strength and value because … because … because …”\n\n\nThen make sure you add the second part of emotional support and then practical support.\n\n\n“I want you to know that …”\n\n\n“Why don’t we start by …”\n\nThere are examples in the behaviour coaching section of the EFFT manual (Lafrance et al., 2020) that are similar to Serena’s situation.\n\n\nIf you are interested in accessing more resources, feel free to peruse the following websites:\n\nRecovery Nation (n.d.)\nSmart Recovery (n.d.)",

    "text": "Overview\nIn this unit we will spend some time discussing a subject that we tend to avoid—death accompanied by grieving. Grieving can be challenging in a culture that often ignores loss and avoids discussing its impact, as H. Norman Wright points out at the start of his book, Experiencing Grief, which you’ll have the opportunity to read later in this unit. Wright notes, “When we add this silence to the fact that most of us have never been taught about the process and normalcy of grief and death, no wonder we struggle” (2004, p. 1).\nOur fear and pain surrounding death are intensified by the uncertainty it brings, raising questions that lack definitive answers. For those with faith, their belief can provide some comfort—a sense of peace about what comes after death. However, this comfort does not eliminate the pain of losing a loved one, the suffering that may precede death, or the lingering questions and anxieties that often accompany it. As we’ve discussed in earlier units, the experience of suffering and pain is something we naturally strive to avoid at all costs.\nAs with the previous unit, this unit also deals with trauma. In the same way that death can cause trauma to the body, it can cause suffering to the brain of those left behind as well. This unit will not go into detail about how the brain is affected, but keep in mind what you learned from the first unit about trauma and the brain.",

    "section": "3.1 What is Grief?",
    "text": "3.1 What is Grief?\nWhen a person endures a loss they will inevitably experience grief. At some point in our lives, we all face grief. The nature of the loss shapes an individual’s grieving experience. Loss can occur in many forms: the death of a loved one, the end of a meaningful relationship, losing a job, facing a disability, or enduring the illness of a loved one. Whether grief stems from a loved one’s passing or a terminal diagnosis, it is a powerful, sometimes overwhelming emotion. Grief can leave a person feeling numb or disconnected from daily life. To better cope with grief at various stages, experts recommend learning about the grieving process. Understanding the underlying causes of significant emotions, such as guilt over a loss, can help in navigating them.\n\n3.1.1 Activity: Watch | What is Grief?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJulia Samuel talks about what grieving is and what the process is like. Note that she brings up a similar concept to that we have read about in previous units: it’s not so much the event surrounding the death, but having to go through the process on our own without community. Watch the following videos.\n\nWhat is Grief? (2017b)\n\n\n\n\n\nThings That can Help Us Grieve (2017a)\n\n\n\n\nWhat is it like to be a dying patient? An older video by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross explains what matters most in the end and what it is like to die.\n\nUnderstanding Death and Suicide: Part 1 (2010)\n\n\n\n\nWhat dying looks like: Katherine Mannix explains what the signs we see toward the end of life actually mean. It is really important for you to understand this for your own experience of death, as well as when you are interacting with clients to provide them with some psychoeducation.\n\nDying is Not as Bad as You Think (2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Activity: Watch | Kübler-Ross’ Five Stages of Grief\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the first models in this field was the five stages of grief, which we will cover in this section. It is important to acknowledge and learn from our past, even if not everyone uses this model.\nWatch Elisabeth Kübler Ross’ Five Stages of Grief. She was a major influence on how hospice care is structured today. Prior to watching this clip it is important to note that the model was developed for dying patients, not for those who are left behind or are mourners. It may be more appropriate to apply this model to clients who are dying rather than those who are grieving.\n\nFive Stages of Grief (2012)\n\n\n\n\nI also invite you to read the following excerpts from Kübler-Ross’ book On Death and Dying (1970). This part of the activity is optional.\n\npp. 37–53, 76–86, 105–117, 132\n\nTWU has purchased an online version for our use; it can be accessed here:\n\nOnline version On Death and Dying (1970)\nPhysical copy On Death and Dying (1970)\n\nStudents can access the full text via the EPUB Full Text link on the left; you are able to download up to 25 pages of the book content.\nQuestions to Consider\n\nWhy is partial denial considered healthy?\nWhen should a dialogue about death take place?\nWhy is anger a hard stage to deal with?\nWhy does anger occur?\nWhat does bargaining attempt to do?\nWhat might promises or bargaining be associated with?\nWhat are the two different types of depression outlined?\nWhy is it not helpful to reassure or tell a sad, dying person to be happy or not be sad?\nWhat feelings are present at the acceptance stage?\nWho needs the most help during this stage?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Activity: Optional Read | Experiencing Grief\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to complete this optional reading you will need to purchase the book Experiencing Grief by H. Norman Wright (2004). This is not a required text; however it may be valuable to you if you are interested in working in the area of grief or if you have experienced grief yourself. Again, this is an optional reading and the text does not have to be purchased, nor does the reading have to be completed.\nNorman Wright describes grief from what seems to me like an inner monologue of his own experiences and wrestlings mixed in with his readings. There are some good descriptions and metaphors in the text that may help you connect to the information in a different way. This is also an opportunity to read this little book and decide whether or not you feel like this would be a good resource to pass on. As Timothy Keller discusses in his book Walking with God Through Pain and Suffering (2013), each person’s experience of grief is so unique that we have to remember that what may work for one person may not work for another, and in fact can even have the potential to make things worse. However, this does not imply that you should not pass on resources, but rather that you should be very careful about why you pass on resources, and to whom.\nIn contrast to our previous readings from Kübler Ross, this focuses on grieving from the perspective of a bereaved individual.\nQuestions to Consider\n\nWhy is the imagery that grief is like waves of an ocean so applicable?\nWhat are the multitude of emotions involved in the grief process?\nWhat types of losses tend not to be understood or acknowledged?\nWhy is it important to cry?\nWhat puts you at risk for complicated grieving?\nWhat are the four signs of recovery? How long would it typically take to appear?\n\nA Moment of Reflection\nWhat role does grief, loss, and death play in your life? In your church life?\nI wonder sometimes if we use the Bible and God’s teachings to invalidate the suffering of those around us, similar to what we are learning in EFFT about the but statements … “Yeah it makes sense that you are suffering, but God will redeem this experience, but God tells us not to worry, but …”\nThink about Easter, Jesus dying, suffering an excruciating death on the Cross. If we don’t allow ourselves to feel this we will never fully understand the depth of the Father’s love for us. When we avoid grief or try to have it pass by quickly we miss out on the ability to connect on a deeper level with ourselves, with creation, with others, and most importantly with God.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Activity: Websites Exploration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease browse the following two websites for additional resources, training, and information on grief, both for those who are dying and for those who are grieving.\n\nElisabeth Kübler Ross Foundation (n.d.)\nThe Art of Dying Well (n.d.)",

    "section": "3.2 How Does Grief or Loss and Death Affect Us?",
    "text": "3.2 How Does Grief or Loss and Death Affect Us?\nGrief can cause emotional or physical symptoms in a person. In the early stages of grief almost anything that people experience is normal, such as feeling extremely overwhelmed, questioning religious or spiritual beliefs, feeling mad, feeling upset, or being resentful. It is possible to mourn for months or years. As time passes and as the bereaved adjust to life without a loved one, to the news of a terminal diagnosis, or to the possibility of losing someone they love, pain usually becomes more manageable.\nThe purpose of this section is to discuss how grief or loss and death affect us. Being Mortal (Gawande, 2017) is an outstanding book that I strongly recommend you read in its entirety to gain a clear understanding of the broader system at work and how it influences the individual’s process. Additionally, we will read an article that provides three ways to explain how grief and loss affect us, both from the perspective of the dying and from the perspective of the mourner. In order to conclude this topic, we will examine the Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG) scale. There will be references to complex grief in our readings, but we will not go into specifics due to the limited time we have together.\n\n3.2.1 Activity: Read | A Personal Journey Through the Grief and Healing Process\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you read the following article you will have the opportunity to gain an understanding of how grief or loss and death affect us from the point of view of three main clinicians/researchers in this field. An online version of this article is available through TWU’s library.\n\nA Personal Journey Through the Grief and Healing Process (2008)\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nWhat are the six stages of change that Satir has developed? What is the added stage?\nWhat does the stage of chaos do? What does it have the potential to do as a lasting outcome?\nHow does the author apply these six stages, specifically the chaos stage, to dealing with a death or loss?\nWhat are Kübler-Ross’ five stages?\nWhat are Worden’s four tasks?\nWhich models does the author combine to describe the process for the dying and then to describe the process for the grieving?\nWhat was the hardest stage for the author?\nWhat does the process of change do?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Activity: Read | Being Mortal, Chapter 1, The Independent Self\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAtul Gawande’s book Being Mortal (2017) is a great resource for you to examine how views of the elderly have shifted in our culture, starting with the first chapter. It is my hope that you will come back to this reading when you have time as the entire book presents important viewpoints on the topic.\nDeath and dying is not explicitly discussed in Chapter 1, but how we view the elderly is important, because our avoidance of interaction with elderly people and thinking about this stage of our lives is arguably a result of avoiding thinking about our own deaths.\n\nBeing Mortal: Chapter 1, The Independent Self (2017)\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nHow does the way contemporary society treats its elderly members compare to how the elderly are treated in most of human history?\nWhat are the eight activities of daily living and the eight independent activities of daily living?\nHow does new technology change the way we treat our elderly?\nDescribe the shift from elderly people living with or needing to live with family to the creation of the “retirement” phase.\nFinish the following quote, “Modernization did not demote the elderly. It demoted the _________” (Gawande, 2017, p. 22).\nWhat has the veneration of elders been replaced with?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Activity: Read | Being Mortal, Chapter 2, Things Fall Apart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this chapter is to describe the various trajectories our lives can take and what will occur to our bodies in these scenarios. Furthermore, this chapter explores the priorities we have in our culture, in particular those related to dying and aging, and how, despite the fact that there are ways to be properly supported in our elder years, we do not prioritize this enough to bring about such change. This chapter is important for us to read—I am hoping it stimulates some thoughts about how we deal with the elderly and ultimately with death, and how our avoidance of talking about aging and death may be preventing us from receiving appropriate care at this time of our lives.\nBecoming more comfortable with talking about death is not only beneficial for us psychologically, but also biologically. In order to contribute to the continuation of this conversation, Gawande’s book is a worthwhile and necessary read. I urge all of you to read the remainder of it when you have time.\n\nBeing Mortal: Chapter 2, Things Fall Apart (2017)\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nWhy is it that even though a diagnosis may have been present for a long time, death can still come as a surprise?\nWhat two revolutions have the advances of modern medicine given us?\nWhy is it that studying aging is studying an unnatural process?\nWhat is the condition known as frailty?\nWhy did the doctor say you must always examine the feet of an elderly person?\nWhat did the University of Minnesota centre study? Why was the centre shut down?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Activity: Complicated Grief\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease search online to find and review the inventory of complicated grief (ICG). It is recommended that you take the ICG for experience; however, if you have recently suffered a loss and this activity would trigger too many emotions for you, please feel free to skip it. Scoring for the ICG is out of 76; a score of 25 or greater indicates a person is at high risk for requiring clinical care.\nThere is much research in the literature about complicated grief, how it develops, and treatments that are appropriate for it, however it will be too much for our unit to include this. I encourage you to recall, instead, the readings by H. Norman Wright on Experiencing Grief (2004) as he writes a little bit about complicated grief toward the end of his book.\nRecommended Resource\nMary Frances O’Connor has done a lot of research in the field of grief, relating it to biology. If you are interested in reading some of her articles, and specifically her articles on complicated grief, I have provided her website for you to peruse. This is added reading however and does not need to be completed for this unit.\n\nMary-Frances O’Connor: Research (n.d.)",

    "section": "3.3 How Do We Work with Grief?",
    "text": "3.3 How Do We Work with Grief?\nRecent research suggests that grief does not necessarily follow the linear, predictable stages once widely accepted. However it remains broadly understood that grief is a process aimed at recovering meaning after a loss (Brown, 2021). The risk factors for complicated grief are diverse, including depression, anxiety, poor physical health, attachment issues, low perceived social support, family conflict near the end of life, and difficulty accepting death. Understanding these factors can help guide the appropriate support needed.\nThere is no doubt that there is a great deal of information available regarding grief management. We will be spending most of our time in this section gaining a greater understanding of EFFT related to grief management.\nDuring this topic you will have the opportunity to increase your knowledge of how to work with grief. You have read in previous sections about some suggested models to work with grief. Grief can also be approached and modelled in many other ways. In preparation for your oral presentation assignment, you will have the opportunity to research some treatment models.\n\n3.3.1 Activity: Read | Generating a Vocabulary of Mourning: Supporting Families Through the Process of Grief\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the premise that bereavement practices can help mitigate the chances of complex grief developing, this article explores a variety of mourning practices. As well, it argues that clinicians should receive training in mourning and bereavement practices in order to assist in the treatment of their clients. Additionally, the article emphasizes the importance not only of understanding the broader system, but also of taking into account the unique needs of the individual within the system.\n\nGenerating a Vocabulary of Mourning: Supporting Families Through the Process of Grief (2020)\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nWhat is a preventative factor for the development of complex grief?\nWhat do bereavement practices intend to do?\nWhat are the common themes across religious practices that Goodwyn has developed?\nWhat is the role of the counsellor?\nWhat are the two considerations highlighted for further research?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Activity: Review | Emotion-Focused Family Therapy, Chapters 1–2 | Read Chapter 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section we will revisit how EFFT can be applied in our work with grief, loss, and death: EFFT, along with the ability to validate emotions, offers a way to express unspeakable moments by providing language and bridging the gap between the prefrontal cortex and the limbic system. The goal of this exercise is to learn how to guide emotional experiences even when words are unavailable. The use of EFFT aligns well with the ideas presented in the preceding article, as the author emphasizes that every individual’s grieving process is unique, influenced by various factors. Therefore, effective validation skills will be crucial throughout this journey.\nIn addition, we will spend some time discussing death and dying. This is a topic that we tend to avoid discussing—reasons for this vary from individual to individual. This is referred to as working through blocks. In this section, we will conduct a personal exercise related to this topic.\n\nReview Chapters 1 and 2, and read Chapter 5 in Lafrance et al. (2020)\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nWhat are three things conditioned responses are based on?\nDescribe what a block is.\nWhat is block work?\nWhat is the main paralyzing emotion that fuels blocks in caregivers?\nWhen is caregiver resentment most likely to surface?\nDescribe what the authors mean by the wisdom in the blocks? What does it help us do?\nWhat is the tree metaphor?\nName some of the self-assessment tools.\nWhat is the benefit of “speaking into the void”?\nWhat are some other techniques listed that can regulate emotions in a caregiver?\n\nExercise: Block Work\nAs we work through a block we will focus on the psychoeducational component. In spite of the fact that you have read about how you can work with caregivers to work with blocks, I would like you to take the opportunity to apply it to yourself at this time, especially with regard to the subject of death. As we have discussed in this unit, death and loss are topics that tend to be avoided in our culture, but research shows that those who are dying and those who are grieving need to talk about it. Having stated this before, I would argue that it is for this reason that we do not have proper systems in place in North America to provide assistance, honour, and support to the elderly. Gawande (2017) stated in our reading above that we have come to venerate independence above all else. In order to avoid experiencing pain in those vulnerable places, we avoid going there.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: The EFFT Tree Metaphor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource:  by Jasmine Pang.\nWhen I hear/talk/think about death OR\nWhen I interact with/think about the elderly I feel … (emotions–roots) … and therefore I react with … (pattern–branches).\nAfter you identify the block and validate for yourself why it is present, I encourage you to implement the premise behind the relationship dimensions scale, which is to do the exact opposite of what you normally do. For example, if you never talk about death, seek out someone you trust to have that conversation with. If you have someone in your life that is elderly such as a grandparent or a parent and you never ask them about how they are doing with their deteriorating bodies or if they think about the end, maybe open up that conversation.\nExercise: Validation of Silence\nWe read briefly about the validation of silence in our chapter on caregiver blocks. The exercise is normally performed with a loved one who does not respond to a bid for connection—i.e., “’speaking into the void.” I would like you to apply the same format and premise to someone who feels “blocked” about speaking about death and dying.\nImagine after trying to engage in a discussion and response that you receive no answer, or silence. How would you validate the person? Their fears? Their block in talking about this with you? You can use the guide at the back of the Lafrance et al. text on pages 169–170 to help you format your response. I encourage you to write it out.\nAn alternative to writing out a validation of silence for someone else could be for you to write a validation to yourself about your own silence on the subject. You can use the exercise that you did with the tree metaphor to help guide your response.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Activity: Optional Reading | Walking with God Through Pain and Suffering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe book Walking With God Through Pain and Suffering by Timothy Keller (2013) is an excellent resource for those interested in learning more about theology of suffering and pain. Only the content that pertains to our topic in this section will be read. Despite the fact that Keller is primarily discussing pain and suffering, his words are applicable to our discussion on grief, loss, and death, as they are also engulfed in worlds of pain and suffering.\nRead Chapter 11 which you can find here:\n\nWalking With God Through Pain and Suffering, Chapter 11 (2013)\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nWhat is the main metaphor describing how to experience pain and suffering and what is the idea behind it?\nWhat is the difference between being in the fire versus having the fire within yourself?\nWhat is the metaphor of the mixed gold?\nWhat is the paradoxical balance of confidence and humility in the response of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego?\nWe have been exploring how experiencing pain, loss, death, and suffering change us and open us up to access a deeper place within—how does Keller expand on this discussion?\nHow does Keller frame “the furnace?” How does he recommend viewing being in the furnace?\n\nBy inviting you to read this chapter I hope to initiate a discussion regarding how God views our pain, our suffering, and our losses. The presence of death is accompanied by the presence of pain. The following are three “takeaways” from this chapter:\n\nWhen suffering, pain, death, and loss are present, God uses these experiences to deepen us, to draw us closer to Him, and to shape us in the process.\nWhen we are in the depths of despair and we cry out to God, our call is not to simply believe enough and then God will answer our prayers—our call is to put our trust primarily in God and His wisdom and not our own. There is a surrender in this process which is extremely hard to do. Going through the stages of grief or taking time to work on oneself may need to occur before this can happen.\nJesus was thrown in the ultimate fire for you and experienced this process completely on His own. In knowing this, can you trust Him with your small fires?\n\nRead Chapter 12, “Weeping,” which you can find here:\n\nWalking with God Through Pain and Suffering, Chapter 12 (2013)\n\nWe can apply the concepts from this chapter to all of our units so far, as well as to our units to come. As scripture tells us, there is a time for everything: a time for weeping and despair is included in this and Keller expands on the importance of weeping for healthy emotional development, as well as a means for drawing us closer to God.\nQuestions to Consider\n\nWhy did Christians feel the need to eliminate lamenting?\nHow did God respond to Elijah during his time of suffering? Who did God send?\nWhat does creating a climate of care do?\nWhat are the three lessons that the Psalms teach us?\nHow does weeping drive us into joy? How can we experience seemingly paradoxical emotions at the same time?",

Upon completion of this unit you will hopefully have a better understanding of how to begin interacting with death, the systemic view of death, dying, and the elderly, as well as the importance of confronting our own fears and hesitations concerning death before we are able to assist our clients. Being the “conversation starters” about death also places us in a position to be an instrument of change. Creating more of a comfort and vocabulary around death, grieving, and loss on a societal level will create huge change on the systemic level. We can be a part of this movement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking Your Learning\n\n\n\nBefore you move on to the next unit you may want to check that you are able to:\n\nWho are some of the major researchers in the field of grief and loss that you can name?\nHow do societal and cultural views of death and dying shape an individual’s experience?\nWhat is your own relationship to death, and how do you notice yourself interacting with it?\nCan you describe a scenario where someone is experiencing grief and loss?\nHow would you apply the EFFT skill of validation in a conversation about grief?\nIf you were supporting someone through grief, what would your preliminary treatment plan include, and where would you look for additional resources or specialized training?",

    "section": "4.1 What are Depression, Suicidality, and Eating Disorders?",
    "text": "4.1 What are Depression, Suicidality, and Eating Disorders?\nSuicidality, eating disorders, and depression are some of the “main” mental health issues that one might encounter in the therapy room. These issues will only be touched upon in this unit. In our EFFT text we have been learning that mental health issues are caused by unprocessed emotions. Rather than experiencing things that cause mental health issues, it is experiencing them alone without the ability to process what is happening that causes the issue. According to EFFT, mental health issues would not occur if we were able to process emotions correctly. Both trauma and addiction can be comorbid.\nIt may seem that the first two topics are disjointed from previous topics, but the purpose is to pique your interest and introduce you to the researchers and clinicians in this field. Throughout this unit I encourage you to draw upon and incorporate what you have learned in the previous units, particularly about the brain and how it interacts with these issues.\n\nDepression\nThe medical term depression (major depressive disorder) refers to a serious, common psychological illness that negatively affects a person’s feelings, thoughts, and actions. An individual suffering from depression may experience sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities they previously enjoyed. Depression may also make it difficult for an individual to perform their duties at work or at home. There may be a variety of emotional and physical problems associated with it.\nThere is a wide range of symptoms associated with depression, ranging from mild to severe. These include feeling sad or depressed, losing interest in activities that used to be enjoyable, losing weight or gaining weight because of changes in appetite, oversleeping, difficulty sleeping, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty concentrating, thinking, or making decisions, and thoughts of suicide or death.\n\n\n4.1.1 Activity: Video | Neuroscience of Depression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI invite you to watch the following YouTube clip to introduce yourself to the various hypotheses that link brain activity to the development and maintenance of depression.\n\n10-Minute Neuroscience: Depression (2023)\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nWhat are some of the hypotheses that this video covers?\nWhat has been the traditional or original hypothesis? Why?\nWhat is neuroplasticity and neurogenesis?\nWhat area of the brain does neuroplasticity and neurogenesis take place in?\n\nOptional Video | How Depression Affects the Brain\n\nHow Depression Affects the Brain – Yale Medicine Explains (2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Activity: Read | I Don’t Want to Talk About It\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his work as a psychotherapist, Terry Real has made a significant contribution to the discussion of male depression and advocacy for it. The publication of his book I Don’t Want to Talk About It (1997) created a significant wave in the field of psychology, and he has been presenting on the subject ever since. Real incorporates his own narrative and his own journey through depression into the book. The teaser below is only a brief excerpt, and you are encouraged to read the whole book.\n\nMen’s Hidden Depression, Chapter 1 (1997)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter reading the chapter consider the following questions:\n\nHow does this description of Real’s father relate to the intersection of both trauma and depression?\nWhy do we tend not to recognize depression in men?\nWhat is the percentage of people who never get help for depression?\nWhat, according to Real, produces depression?\nWhat are some of the signs of depression in men?\nWhat do people tend to view depression as?\nWhat compounds a depressed man’s condition?\nWhy do men die earlier than women?\nWhat is the stigma around depression?\nWhat is covert depression?\n\nPlease view the following video, not for information regarding psychotherapy or suicide psychology, but rather to understand what Terry Real is describing as male hidden depression in this video.\n\nWhat I Learned From My Husband’s Suicide (2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Activity: Familiarize Yourself With the PHQ-9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a moment to read a patient health questionnaire that is commonly used to assess depression in patients. This is one of many scales available.\n\nPatient Health Questionnaire—PHQ-9 (1999)\n\n\n\n\n\nSuicidality\nSuicidality includes suicide attempts as well as suicidal ideation. A suicidal ideation is the presence of suicidal thoughts. A person may experience suicidal ideation in a variety of ways, from fleeting and unwelcome thoughts, to a preoccupation with death that requires extensive planning.\nIn this section you will read older sources which provide a very good explanation of what suicide is. It is important to note, however, that we no longer refer to someone as committing suicide, but rather as someone dying by suicide. Making this distinction is important, as it emphasizes the importance of depression and suicide, and how in those extremely dark moments, it would not be a choice to commit suicide.\n\n\n4.1.4 Activity: Watch & Read | Shneidman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdwin Shneidman is known as the “father of suicide” and has used the term “psychache” to describe the psychological pain that underlies suicidal acts. Take note in this article of both his name and the reference to his coined term “psychache,” as it is one of our goals throughout this course to refer to some of the original researchers.\nWatch the following video of Dr. Shneidman talking about some of his work.\n\nMy Suicide Shneidman Sequence QT (2014)\n\n\n\n\nQuestions for Reflection\n\nHow did you respond to the way Shneidman talks about suicidology?\nIs there anything that you would agree or disagree with and why?\n\nRead Shneidman’s Contributions to the Understanding of Suicidal Thinking (2006)\nQuestions to Consider\n\nWhat is psychache?\nWhat did Shneidman analyze as his preliminary research?\nWhat are the 10 commonalities of suicide?\nWhat is the cubic model of suicide?\nWhat is the most dangerous period for a suicide attempt?\nWhat measure did Shneidman develop?\nWhat was a central aspect to Shneidman’s clinical approach?\nWhat is anodyne therapy? How does it relate to EFFT?\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.5 Activity: Read | Suicide Clusters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the following research article about suicide clusters.\n\nSuicide Clusters: A Review of Risk Factors and Mechanisms (2013)\n\nWatch the following video about suicide clusters (note that the video is 6:42 minutes long).\n\n‘Suicide Cluster’ in Palo Alto: Students Share Stories of Anxiety, Depression (2016)\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nConsider the following questions to help guide your learning.\n\nWhat is the definition of a suicide cluster?\nWhat are the two types of clusters?\nWhat population is most at risk for suicide clusters?\nWhat gender are suicide clusters more common among?\nWhere is the copycat effect more prevalent?\nWhat does “contagion” mean?\nWhat is the Werther effect?\nWhat does the process of imitation rely on?\nWhat is priming?\nList some of the proposed theories of suicide clusters.\n\n\n\n\n\nEating Disorders\nAn eating disorder is a behavioural condition characterized by persistent and severe disturbances of eating behaviours, as well as distressing thoughts and emotions. Physical, psychological, and social functioning can all be affected by these conditions. In addition to anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, avoidant restriction of food intake disorder, and pica and rumination disorders, there are several other eating disorders.\n\n\n4.1.6 Activity: Watch | What is an Eating Disorder?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCynthia Bulik, a leading researcher in the field of eating disorders, gives an overview of what eating disorders are and how common they are.\n\nCynthia Bulik on Eating Disorders (2010)\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter watching the video consider the following questions to help you track your learning.\n\nWhat are the three different types of eating disorders discussed and what are their descriptions?\nHow prevalent are eating disorders?\nWhat contributes to an eating disorder?\nIn which eating disorder is the sex ratio more equal?\nWhat new research is coming?\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.7 Activity: Optional Read | Emotional Eating\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanet Treasure is a well-known therapist and professor in the field of eating disorders in England. She has published a number of papers, and also focuses on the role of the family in the healing process. Her animal models appear in our manual on EFFT.\nRead the following article by Treasure and her colleagues (2022):\n\nNovel Approaches to Tackling Emotional Loss of Control of Eating Across the Weight Spectrum (2022)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter reading, consider the following questions and use them to help you keep track of your learning.\n\nWhat are the three types of eating disorders?\nWhy don’t people with binge eating disorder generally seek help?\nWhat risk factors are associated with binge eating disorder?\nWhat system in the brain is overeating associated with?\nWhat might drive overeating after it becomes a habit? Changing from “outcome driven” to …?\nWhat are the key neurotransmitters involved in body weight, appetite, and food intake?",

    "section": "4.2 What Causes Mental Health Issues?",
    "text": "4.2 What Causes Mental Health Issues?\nThe aim of this discussion is to explore some of the potential causes of mental health issues. It’s important to note that identifying a single cause of mental illness is often difficult, as multiple factors can contribute to its development. As we have previously discussed, these factors may include early adverse life experiences such as trauma, as well as a history of abuse, whether directly experienced or witnessed. Refer back to the diagram we looked at earlier, which outlines various contributors to the development of mental health issues. Extensive research also shows that mental health problems can be linked to chronic medical conditions such as cancer or diabetes. Additionally, biological factors, chemical imbalances in the brain, and changes in brain structure due to alcohol or drug use can play significant roles. Our brains, bodies, and emotions are deeply interconnected, making it challenging to pinpoint direct causes and effects.\nIn this section we will discuss some of the research behind why mental health issues occur. As we continue our study of the brain, draw upon the knowledge you have gained from the previous units. The topic of depression will be discussed first, followed by suicidality, and then eating disorders.\n\nDepression\nWhile depressive disorders are often labelled as chemical imbalances, this oversimplifies their complexity. Research shows that depression isn’t simply caused by a lack or excess of certain brain chemicals. Factors such as faulty mood regulation, genetic vulnerability, and stressful life events all contribute, often interacting with one another. Individuals with similar symptoms of depression may have entirely different underlying causes, and respond to different treatment approaches.\n\n\n4.2.1 Activity: Read | I Don’t Want to Talk About It, Chapter 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerry Real’s book provides insight into how and why depression develops. This chapter will focus on the relationship between trauma and depression, which we discussed extensively in our first unit.\nAs you will see in the following chapter, Real is a very systemic therapist. Notice the emphasis on process rather than content—how the client is showing up rather than what the client wishes to discuss or share. Observe how Real’s approach relates to our learning of EFFT.\n\nI Don’t Want to Talk About It, Chapter 4 (1997)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter reading this chapter, consider the following questions and use them as a tool to help you process the information from your reading.\n\nWhy is crisis a potential ally in therapy?\nWhat is a body memory?\nWhat needs to stop in order for underlying depression to rise to the surface?\nWhat did John Bowlby study and how does it relate to the manifestation of depression?\nWhat does childhood injury in boys create?\nWhat is major depression versus dysthymia?\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Activity: Optional Read | The Bible, Psalm 88\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a look at Psalm 88, one of the darkest psalms in the Bible.\n\nReflect\n\nIn what state is the author in despair and what questions does he ask?\nIs there anything in this that stirs your emotions?\n\n\n\n\n\nSuicide\nSuicide ideation is a very prevalent issue in our society. For those who have never experienced suicide ideation or been close to that moment of contemplation, it can be difficult to imagine the reasoning behind how this can occur. In this next section we will explore why suicide ideation might occur and why such ideation can lead to dying by suicide. As with our previous units, we will spend time looking at the brain and what brain activity occurs when suicide ideation is present.\n\n\n4.2.3 Activity: Video | Suicide and the Brain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Daniel Amen is a prominent researcher who studies the brain in relation to mental health problems; we have previously discussed some of his work.\nHe is not a very empathetic speaker, and some do not agree with some of his approaches (for example guilting clients). Nevertheless, he is a solid researcher and it is important to understand his perspective and how he looks at the brain.\n\nThe Science Behind Suicidal Thoughts (2019)\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter watching the video consider the following questions and use them as a tool to help you process the information.\n\nWhat is the percentage of people who have entertained the thought of suicide?\nHow many have attempted suicide?\nIn those who died by suicide, what area of the brain had lower functioning?\nWhat are some conditions that can be associated with dying by suicide?\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.4 Activity: Read | Risk Factors for Depression and Suicide Ideation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this activity you will read two articles and reflect on their respective questions. The second article is an optional read. In the first article you will learn about the risk factors associated with adolescents with complex depression.\nVan Velzen, L. S., Toenders, Y. J., Kottaram, A., Youzchalveen, B., Pilkington, V., Cotton, S. M., Brooker, A., McKechnie, B., Rice, S., & Schmaal, L. (2023). Risk factors for suicide attempt during outpatient care in adolescents with severe and complex depression. Crisis: The Journal of Crisis Intervention and Suicide Prevention.\n\nRisk Factors for Suicide Attempt During Outpatient Care in Adolescents With Severe and Complex Depression (2023)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter reading, consider the following questions and use them as a tool to help you process the information.\n\nWhy is suicide risk assessment a crucial part of suicide prevention?\nWhat are some of the risk factors that have been identified by previous studies?\nWhat are some risk factors identified by this study?\nHow might parental divorce or separation increase suicide risk in adolescents?\nWhat were the authors’ conclusions?\n\nHere is an article that addresses all three mental health issues that we are discussing. As we have stated previously, mental health issues have the potential to affect one another and coexist with one another.\n\nThe Role of Body Image and Disordered Eating as Risk Factors for Depression and Suicidal Ideation in Adolescents (2009)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter reading, consider the following questions and use them as a tool to help you process the information.\n\nWhy do research results suggest that bulimic symptoms are related to depression?\nHow much higher is the risk of suicide for those struggling with anorexia versus the broader public?\nHow are suicide ideation and body image related?\nWhat did this study hypothesize or predict?\nWhat was found to have a direct effect on suicide ideation?\nWhat are the implications of these findings?\nWas gender a factor in the results?\nWhat are some of the limitations of this study?\n\n\n\n\n\nEating Disorders\nThe exact cause of eating disorders is unknown. As previously discussed, there are many possible causes of mental illness. Psychological, environmental, and social factors may contribute to the development of eating disorders in some individuals due to their genes and relational issues.\n\n\n4.2.5 Activity: Video | Eating Disorders and the Brain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this video you will learn how eating disorders affect the brain, and what is the difference between a well-functioning brain and a brain affected by an eating disorder.\n\nThe Eating Disorder Brain vs. The Well Brain: Effects of the Starving Brain and Eating Disorders (2021)\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter watching the video, consider the following question and use it as a tool to help you process the information.\n\nWhat is the difference between a well brain and an eating disorder brain?\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.6 Activity: Read | Eating Disorders and Generational Influences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the EFFT curriculum we are taught that families have a profound impact on treatment outcomes. I have selected the following article in order to illustrate this point.\n\nLast Word: Ending the Intergenerational Transmission of Body Dissatisfaction and Disordered Eating: A Call to Investigate the Mother-Daughter Relationship (2021)\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nWhat is a predictor of subclinical and clinical eating disorders?\nWhat do mothers act as and why is that important?\nHow can eating disorders be influenced directly and indirectly?\nDid endorsing lower body satisfaction motivate girls to engage in healthful habits? Why or why not?\nWhat is the “call to action?” What do the authors recommend?\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.7 Activity: Optional Read | Eating Disorders and Caregiver Involvement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn important study related to eating disorders and EFFT intervention is reported in this research article. It is likely that by this point you will recognize some of the researchers’ names and have some understanding of some of the concepts they are discussing.\n\nThe Influence of Carer Fear and Self-Blame When Supporting a Loved One With an Eating Disorder, Eating Disorders: The Journal of Treatment and Prevention (2016).\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter reading, consider the following questions and use them as a tool to help you process the information.\n\nWhat was identified as the most necessary factor for a positive outcome for clients?\nWhat was the result of the EFFT 2-day caregiver workshop?\nWhat happens when caregivers experience intense emotion?\nWhat is the hypothesis for this study? What are the authors hoping to prove?\nWhat did they find that fear predicted?\nWhat was one concern that was brought up about caregiver involvement? What were the suggestions to help mitigate this?",

    "text": "4.3 How Do We Work With Mental Health Issues\nTo effectively assist a client or friend or family member with a mental health issue it is helpful to know what resources are available both to support the client or loved one as well as to support you. As there are many variables to consider when treating mental health issues, each client’s treatment will differ. This topic will include readings and activities designed to facilitate this learning.\nEFFT was developed as a result of studies conducted with people who suffer from eating disorders. Thus, you will find this section to be complementary to your learnings about EFFT. We will begin by exploring some of the community resources that are available.\n\n4.3.1 Activity: Explore | Community Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you have access to any resources in the area where you work? When a crisis arises, how can you help? The following are just a few options available; we recommend exploring more.\nSuicidality\n\nLines for Life: Services and Crisis Lines (n.d.)\nThe Crisis Centre of BC (n.d.)\n\nDepression\n\nHealthline: How can I get Help for Depression (n.d.)\n\nEating Disorders\n\nNational Eating Disorder Information Centre (n.d.)\n\nGeneral Help\n\nFoundry: You Matter (n.d.)\neMentalHealth (n.d.)\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Activity: Practice | Emotion Coaching and Behaviour Coaching\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section we will practice our skills of emotion coaching and behaviour coaching. While this may seem repetitive, the more you practice, the easier it will become. The EFFT manual (Lafrance et al., 2020) contains suggestions for behaviour coaching strategies for depression, as well as what people with depression require in terms of emotional support. As an example, consider a scenario in which a parent seeks your assistance with their child who is suffering from depression. You will assist the parent in developing a script that they can use at home with their child.\nUse the tool below to help in developing your script. Remember that if you close your browser, the work done will not be saved, so you might wish to download or save the file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Activity: EFFT and Suicidality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to conduct a preliminary assessment it is extremely important to understand the signs of possible suicidal behaviour. In accordance with the literature, the risk assessment should not be regarded as an absolute. Continual monitoring and assessment are essential, especially at the beginning of your career. One of the exceptions to confidentiality, (as has been discussed in SOCI 400) is when there is a risk of harm to oneself or another. Whenever you suspect that your client’s life is in danger, you must report it to the appropriate authorities.\n\nSuicide Risk: Detecting & Assessing Suicidality (2019)\n\nFor this section on suicide, you will write a validation statement that explains why someone might commit suicide. Suicide is one of the most difficult issues to validate, since when we validate it, especially in this circumstance, we might feel as though we are encouraging the individual to carry out the action. However, in keeping with what we have read and what the research shows, validation actually gives the other the feeling that they are not alone—that someone understands and is willing to share dark places with them.\nThis validation statement will not be accompanied by an actual scenario. Instead, imagine someone sitting in front of you saying, “I want to end my life,” and think about why they might want to do so.\nUse the tool below to assist you. Remember to save or download your work before you close your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.4 Activity: EFFT and Eating Disorders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has been shown in the literature that parental body image (in particular, a mother’s) and eating habits can be associated with the manifestation of an eating disorder in their loved one. Note that this is a correlation and not a causation. This is important in relieving caregiver self-blame, and then empowering a caregiver or parent to become a part of the healing process. There is evidence to support the benefits of caregiver involvement in the literature we have been reading.\nIf a caregiver has struggled or continues to struggle with an eating disorder or body dysmorphia, it may hinder their ability to participate in the healing process of their loved one.\nComplete the exercise given in the tool below.

    "text": "Overview\nIn Unit 5, both stress and resilience will be explored in detail. While these may appear to be distinct topics, they are deeply interconnected. Stress is an inevitable part of life, arising from various external and internal pressures, while resilience is the capacity to adapt and bounce back from these challenges. The relationship between the two is significant: the more resilient we become, the better we are at managing stress. Although stress will always exist, a resilient individual can approach it differently, viewing obstacles as opportunities for growth rather than insurmountable difficulties. Resilience doesn’t eliminate stress, but it transforms the way we interact with it. With greater resilience, stressful situations are less likely to overwhelm us, and we develop healthier coping mechanisms. Instead of being paralyzed or drained by stress, resilience empowers us to stay grounded, think clearly, and respond effectively. Through building resilience, we gain the tools to reduce the impact of stress on our emotional, mental, and even physical well-being. In other words, by strengthening our resilience, we can significantly alter our experience of stress, making it less of a burden and more of a manageable part of our personal and professional lives.",

    "text": "5.1 Stress and Resilience\nStress and its manifestation in the body are the topics we explore in Unit 5. As research shows, experiencing stress is detrimental to our bodies and our health in general. It is therefore very important to develop and expand our resilience in order to properly handle and interact with stress.\nIn the same manner as in previous units, I would like to acknowledge and hear from those who have contributed to the field of stress and resilience research. Although the scope of research has expanded greatly, it is important to recall where we began.\n\n5.1.1 Activity: Video and Read | The “Fathers” of Stress and Resilience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Hans Seyle\nIn the world of stress management, Hans Selye is widely acknowledged as the “father of the field.” As such, he is a Canadian resource for the rest of the world. Over 1,700 scholarly papers and 39 books were published by Dr. Selye following his first scientific paper to identify and define “stress” in 1936. His work was cited in more than 362,000 scientific papers and in countless popular magazine articles, in nearly every major language, and in every country in the world by the time of his death in late 1982. There is no doubt that he is the most frequently cited author on stress in the world. Selye proposed that throughout a period of exposure to a nonspecific demand, stress remains present in an individual’s body. Among his distinctions, Selye called the cumulative effects of chronically applied stressors “general adaptation syndrome,” also known as Selye’s syndrome in the literature.\nDr. Selye is one of the founders of the Canadian Institute of Stress. You may wish to spend a few minutes exploring their website (n.d.).\nWatch the following video to learn more about one of Dr. Hans Selye’s major contributions to stress research. Please note that the video is 4:01 minutes long.\n\nHans Selye’s General Adaption Syndrome and the HPA Axis: Exploring the Connection (2017)\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter viewing the video consider the following questions and use them as a tool to help you process the information.\n\nWhat is general adaptation syndrome?\nWhat is it better described as?\nWhat is the HPA? How can it weaken?\n\nNorman Garmezy\nThe resilience theory is regarded as the brainchild of Norman Garmezy, the “father” of resilience theory. In addition to his work in developmental psychopathology, Garmezy was a professor of psychology; he held positions at Duke University (1950–1961) and the Institute of Child Development at the University of Minnesota (1961–1989) after receiving his doctorate from the University of Iowa in 1950. His early work focused on the etiology of schizophrenia, but his later work focused on child development risks, resilience, stress, and coping. We will spend some time getting to know his research, even though there have been further advances since his discoveries in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nWe will be reading from Ann Masten’s book, Ordinary Magic (2014).\n\nAnn Masten is a prominent resilience researcher and professor of child development at the University of Minnesota. She is widely recognized for her work on resilience in children and how they thrive despite adversity. In her book Ordinary Magic (2025), Masten explores the concept of resilience, arguing that it is not a rare, extraordinary trait but a common capacity that arises from ordinary human resources such as supportive relationships, problem-solving skills, and community support. The book highlights the power of everyday systems that foster resilience in individuals facing challenges. Masten studied under Garmezy—take note of when he is mentioned.\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter completing the reading above, consider the following questions and use them as a tool to help you process the information.\n\nThe key individuals who initiated studies on resilience in children were a part of which historic event?\nWhat are the four waves of resilience science?\nWhat was the biggest surprise that emerged from the study of children who overcome adversity?\nWhat does the word resilience mean?\nWhat two kinds of evaluation are required to identify resilience in a person’s life?\nWhat are some examples of risk factors?\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Activity: Reading | Stress Management and Prevention, Chapter 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo begin our conversation on stress and its meaning, please read the resource below.\n\nStress Management and Prevention, Chapter 1 (2011)\n\nThis chapter’s Key Questions will be used as our Questions to Consider section. Reading these ahead of time will assist you in guiding your reading.\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter reading, consider the following questions and use them as a tool to help you process the information.\n\nWhat are the different ways that stress can be defined and conceptualized?\nWhat are the different ways that people respond to adversity in their lives?\nStress is ordinarily thought of as a fairly negative state, something to be avoided whenever possible. But how can stress be highly functional and operate as a survival mechanism?\nWhat is the general adaptation syndrome (GAS) and how does it function during times of stress?\nWhat is the primary goal of stress management? Can such a program completely eliminate stress?\nWhat are major sources of stress and how are they recognized?\nHow do you interpret the following statement: Stress is not what exists on the outside, but how you perceive a situation on the inside?\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Activity: Optional Reflection | Stress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the following questions and use the tool below to save your notes. Note that the active browser will not save your responses so you will need to save or download your document before closing it.

For an overview and introduction to resilience, watch the following video. Please consider that this video is 2.29 minutes long.\n\nThe Science of Resilience (2015)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.5 Activity: Videos | Daniel Siegel—Empathy and Resilience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researcher Daniel Siegel is well known for his theory of interpersonal neurobiology, which explains how the brain, mind, and body are interconnected. Throughout his work he emphasizes the importance of resilience. Rather than reading some of his books and articles, we will view some of his YouTube talks:\nBuilding Resilience\n\nBuilding Resilience in Care Providers (2019)\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter watching the video consider the following questions and use them as tools to help you process the information.\n\nWhat are the five states of empathy?\nWhat does compassion build on?\nWhat are the two states of the brain that Siegel describes?\nWhat is the metaphor that Siegel uses about the importance of awareness with resiliency?\n\nOpportunities to Build the Circuits of Kindness and Resilience\nThis next video focuses on parents building resilience with their children.\n\nBuilding the Circuits for Kindness and Resilience (2012)\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter watching the video consider the following questions and use them as tools to help you process the information.\n\nWhen are the first circuits of kindness and resilience growing?\nWhat moments does Siegel encourage us to reframe?\nHow do you see this video by Siegel as related to issues that EFFT explores?\nWhat is the opportunity to build kindness and resilience that Siegel talks about?",

We should note that this is a continuation or a parallel from our previous learning about trauma. You are not expected to memorize all of the details or remember all of the parts of the body affected. This article is intended to give you a general understanding of how stress affects the body and how it can manifest itself.\nRead p. 30 to the end of the chapter.

    "text": "5.3 Strategies for Dealing with Stress and Resilience\nBeing resilient means overcoming setbacks and challenges such as losing a job, facing illness, experiencing a disaster, or grieving a loved one. These stressful events can lead people to unhealthy coping mechanisms such as substance abuse, eating disorders, or risky behaviours, which can make them feel stuck in their problems or victimized. While resilience doesn’t eliminate difficulties, it helps people look beyond them, find joy in life, and handle stress more effectively.\nThis is another opportunity for us to continue learning from EFFT. The goal is for you to have a reasonably good understanding of what validation entails by now. In this section we will develop a validation statement and add a behaviour coaching component.\n\n5.3.1 Activity: Optional Watch | The Power of Vulnerability—Brené Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrené Brown has spent the past two decades studying courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy at the University of Texas at Austin McCombs School of Business. Five of her books are New York Times bestsellers.\nPlease watch this video from Brown, who is well known for her work on vulnerability, shame, courage, and their relationship to resilience before starting the EFFT exercises and reading. It is likely that you have heard Brown speak before, but I encourage you to listen to her again and consider how working on shame, vulnerability, and courage can also cultivate resilience within you while working in the therapy room. This is Brown’s first TED Talk that is well known to most people; it captured the attention of the nation.\n\nThe Power of Vulnerability (2010)\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter watching the video consider the following question and use it to help you process the information.\n\nHow does working on alleviating our shame build and foster resilience? Describe the connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Activity: Watch | Dan Siegel on Neurobiology and Resilience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis short video by Siegel discusses how to build resilience and connection by focusing not only on the individual, but on the collective “we.”\n\nOn Neurobiology and Resilience (2015)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Activity: Case Study\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease refer back to the EFFT Manual (Lafrance et al., 2020) if you need any reminders on emotion coaching or behaviour coaching.\nIn regard to stress and resilience specifically, I quote this text from our EFFT Manual:\n\nThere is strong evidence to suggest that emotional intelligence (which includes emotion management, emotion perception, and emotion utilization) moderates the relationship between stress and mental health concerns in adolescents and adults, including depression, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation (Ciarrochi et al., 2002; Fernández-Berrocal & Extremera, 2006). Taken together, these studies suggest that a focus on the development and refinement of emotion processing and regulation can serve to buffer against the experience of life stressors. For these reasons, the EFFT clinician also works with caregivers to equip them with the skills of emotion coaching to support their loved one’s wellness. Over time, their loved one develops self-efficacy with emotion processing—that is, the capacity and confidence to experience, tolerate, regulate, and be guided by their emotions without need of maladaptive coping strategies. In addition to supporting in the moment emotion processing and the development of the capacity to self-regulate, emotion-coaching skills enhance treatment in various ways. As caregivers adopt this new style of relating to their loved one, their relationship will strengthen and their efforts to support their loved one with behavioral symptoms will be more effective and better received. As symptoms decrease, caregivers can also support their loved one to manage the flood of emotions that sometimes follow. This work will also provide loved ones with evidence of their caregiver’s capacity and willingness to support them with their emotional pain, making it more likely that they will turn to the caregiver for support in times of stress (Lafrance et al., 2020).\n\nRead the following case study and then spend some time creating a validation statement for this particular client. We will be emotion-coaching this client and adding a “behaviour intervention” that will help the client to deal with their ongoing stress in their life. You may come up with your own ideas for things that might help alleviate stress based on the class readings or your own experience, or you can also look up some suggestions if you would like. Note that you would do a lot more work than just this single emotion-coaching session before suggesting a way to cope: in real time, you really need to spend time in validation with the client, really understanding what they are saying and conveying that you “get it.”",

Psychologists, therapists, and counsellors are ethically bound not to explicitly discuss their faith in a counselling session. If you are not directly asked about your faith, you cannot discuss it. Therefore, how should we live in this profession as followers of Christ? We will explore five different perspectives or approaches to integration in this unit. As we proceed through these questions, I invite you to reflect and consider what is most appropriate for you.",

    "section": "6.1 Views and Approaches to Integration",
    "text": "6.1 Views and Approaches to Integration\nWe will be unpacking the five views of approaching faith and counselling that have been compiled by Eric L. Johnson, who is the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary’s Professor of Pastoral Care. Johnson received his doctorate from Michigan State University, and has written a number of books including God under Fire, and Foundations for Soul Care. In addition to writing, Johnson is also an associate editor of the Journal of Psychology and Theology, the Journal of Psychology and Christianity and the Journal of Spiritual Formation and Soul Care. In writing the collection of essays we will explore, he seeks to answer the question, “How can Christians understand and apply psychology as a discipline?” Christian leaders have been grappling with this question as they strive to balance what can sometimes seem contradictory morals and values. What is the most effective way to reconcile these two historically opposing viewpoints? In our readings we will attempt to unravel five different ways in which academics have analyzed this issue.\nIn the following learning activities you will learn more about the five approaches to integration: a levels of explanation view, an integration view, a Christian psychology view, a transformational psychology view, and a Biblical counselling approach. Although I encourage you to read Johnson’s book, for the sake of time it will not be assigned; instead we will be using and benefitting from City Vision University’s series of free lectures that unpack these five views for us. Pay attention to the start and end time provided for the YouTube clips below; you do not need to listen to the entire presentation or video, but we will focus on specific sections. The lectures are provided by Andrew Sears, PhD, and president of City Vision University, an online accredited university located in Kansas City. Consider which view resonates most with you as we walk through each of the views. We will discuss how each of the views appears in the therapy room in our next topic.\n\n6.1.1 Activity: Watch | Introduction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch the following YouTube video to help introduce us to this discussion. We will discuss some of the practical reasons why it is important to explore these different approaches and why it is important to begin formulating our own ideas around this.\nFive Approaches to Counseling and Christianity: A Practical Guide (2021a) (Watch from the beginning to 10:32)\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter watching the video above consider the following questions:\n\nWhat is your calling? To work within more Christian environments, or secular environments? A mix of both? Who are your clients?\nWhere do each of the views tend to be taught?\nHow does Dr. Sears condense the views from five to three?\n\nTake note of the model to help you consider the implications of where you fall.\nOptional Video\n\nSince The Bible is Sufficient for All of Life, Should We Rule Out Psychology in Counseling? (2018)\n\n\n\n\nTo enrich our discussion and to see an example of why it is relevant to consider these views, watch this video. Notice the “how” of the discussion and take note of the points that are being made as we dive deeper into the five approaches.\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter completing the activities above consider the following questions:\n\nWhat is the main question Dr. Sears brings up about integration? What do we need to understand at a deeper level that might be missing?\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Activity: Read & Watch | Levels of Explanation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevels of Explanation & Christian Counselors in Secular Contexts (2021b) (Watch from 1:51 to 6:20 and from 18:50 to the end)\n\n\n\n\nThis is a brief overview of the levels of explanation view. The levels of explanation view holds that there are many ways of looking at an issue—both psychology and theology are two of these ways. How faith and psychology intersect is that theology or faith provides a lens (and we all come to research and scientific inquiry with a lens) that colours how we interpret our findings (or even what we would like to find). It is important that we acknowledge this lens. Along with our beliefs, everyone also has a self-serving lens through which they view the world. All of these factors need to be taken into account when considering how our faith and psychology fit together.\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter completing the activity consider the following questions:\n\nWhat are some of the strengths of the model?\nWhat are some of the weaknesses?\nWhat is the dualism heresy?\n\nRead the following from Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (Johnson, 2012, pp. 23–24).\n\nCounseling and Christianity: Five Approaches\n\nThe repetition here will assist us in better understanding this approach. Feel free to skip this reading if you have a good understanding of the point of view from the video above. If you wish to take notes on this section, please refer to Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (Johnson, 2012) for a concise summary of this approach.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Activity: Watch | An Integration View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLesson 3: Counseling Integration Model and Christian Worldview (2021c) (Watch from start to 10:56)\n\n\n\n\nBefore you begin to engage with this video, here is a little synopsis of what an integration view is; hopefully this will help guide your reading along with the Questions to Consider.\nThe integration view holds that we are responsible to live out our faith in all aspects of our lives and to trust in God’s divine and natural revelation to determine all of our beliefs and practices. This view does not go against science or research but holds to the idea that “all truth is God’s truth,” and God can reveal himself through natural revelation by means of scientific research. This view calls strong integrationists to really study the Word, study Christian integration, and study psychology. This video introduces the idea that the danger of integration is that many therapists don’t receive training in integration and then often become more “secularized” in the process.\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter watching the video consider the following questions:\n\nWhat are the three types of integration?\nWhat is the popular integration slogan?\nWhat are some of the strengths of the model?\nWhat are some of the weaknesses?\n\n\n“Integration is a recursive process of expanding understanding, but always with our most fundamental loyalty being to the true teachings of the special revelation of the Bible. Integration is ultimately the task of the Christian person whom God has led to be a student or scholar of some facet of psychology, with the true teachings of special revelation as the guiding framework for how that person structures his or her deepest beliefs and loyalties” (Johnson, 2010, p. 117).\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.4 Activity: Read | Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches, pp. 149–178\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to fully understand this approach, we will be using repetition. Feel free to skip this reading if you have a thorough understanding of the perspective from the previous readings. You may wish to take notes on the following section in Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (Johnson, 2012) for a succinct summary of this approach. This very brief description will be expanded upon in the reading.\n\nCounseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (2012) Read pages 149–178.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.5 Activity: Read | A Christian Psychology View, Chapter 6, pp. 149–178\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a short summary of a Christian psychology view. This will hopefully assist you in guiding your reading along with the Questions to Consider.\nThe Christian psychology view holds that everyone should interpret psychology from their own set of values, including Christians. So no matter what faith or non-faith perspective you hold, that will be how you interpret, research, and interact with the material (psychology or other), in front of you.\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter completing the reading above, consider the following questions:\n\nWhat is the agenda of Christian psychology?\nWhat areas of psychology are more worldview dependent?\nWhat are the major distinctives that characterize a Christian psychology worldview?\nWhat is the four-dimensional model of Christian psychology?\nWhat are some of the strengths and weaknesses of this model?\n\n\n“However our primary agenda in this chapter was to show the need for Christians to practice their psychology in light of their basic assumptions and the resources of their distinctive tradition. At the most comprehensive level,”tradition validity” for Christians will mean that the Christian worldview, which comes to us from the past, will enable us to meet the challenges of the present faithfully by rationally and empirically demonstrating how essential the love of Christ is for our future” (pp. 173, 174).\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.6 Activity: Read | Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches, pp. 29–31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs noted previously we are using repetition to really help us understand this approach. If you feel you have a good understanding of the view from the videos, feel free to skip this reading. Otherwise, read the following section in Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (Greggo & Sisemore, 2012) for a succinct summary of this approach; you may wish to take notes on this section as well.\n\nCounseling and Christianity: Five Approaches, pp. 29–31 (2012)\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.7 Activity: Read | Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches, pp. 27–29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will be using repetition here to really help us understand this approach. If you feel you have a good understanding of the view from the video, feel free to skip this reading.\nRead the following section in Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (Johnson, 2012)for a succinct summary of this approach; you may take notes on this section if you would like to.\n\nCounseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (2012)\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.8 Activity: Watch | A Transformational Psychology View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a brief overview of a transformational psychology view. In the transformational psychology view, one can take wisdom from both theological and psychological viewpoints, but we need to re-evaluate what traditional psychology would tell us is appropriate psychology. Each area of study needs to be viewed through the lens of both reality and faith. Considering that this approach is based on Christian realities, this approach is only suitable for Christians. It is imperative to note that this approach has a great deal to do with the individual and how close the person is to God–the closer the person is to God, the more profound the psychology. “The bottom line will be that doing science and, in this case, psychology is ultimately an act of love” (Johnson, 2010, p. 199).\n\nTransformative Model: Combining Spiritual Formation and Counseling (2021d)\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter watching the video above, consider the following questions:\n\nWhat are some of the major themes of transformational psychology?\nWhat are the three different spiritual categories?\n\nTake note of the model that compares secular psychology with transformational psychology.\nOptional Watch\nJohn Coe is one of the main contributors to the transformational psychology approach. In this video you can see how Coe talks about transformational psychology, particularly around the concept of spiritual formation.\n\nTalbot Talks: Spiritual Formation with Dr. John Coe (2013)\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter watching the video consider the following questions:\n\nWhat is spiritual theology?\nWho is the agent of change?\nWhy has spiritual formation been misunderstood by the church, according to Coe?\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.9 Activity: Watch | A Biblical Counselling Approach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a brief overview of what a Biblical counselling approach is:\n\nUltimately, a Biblical counselling approach believes that the Bible and Christian faith depict humanity and behaviour in the right light. Psychological insights can be gleaned from this approach, but the Bible possesses the deepest wisdom. “Christian Ministry is a psychotherapy” (p. 245).\n\n\nBiblical Counseling Within Five Approaches to Counseling & Christianity (2021e) (Watch from 00:55-10:45)\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter watching the video above consider the following questions:\n\nWhat is counselling based exclusively on?\nWhat are the limitations of Biblical counselling?\nWhat are the two groups or types of Biblical counselling?\nWhat are the strengths of this approach?\n\nOptional Watch\nDavid Powlison is one of the “big names” in the field of Biblical counselling and the Biblical approach. Watch this video to hear how he talks about how his approach differs from a “regular” counselling approach.\n\nHow Does Biblical Counseling Theory Differ from Psychotherapy? (2011)\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter completing the activities above consider the following question:\n\nWhat are some similarities and some differences between a Biblical approach to counselling versus a “regular” counselling session?\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.10 Activity: Read | Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches, pp. 32–34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs before, if you feel you have a good understanding of the view from the video, feel free to skip this reading, or read the following section in Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (Johnson, 2012)for a succinct summary of this approach. You may wish to take notes on this section.\n\nCounseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (2012)\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.11 Activity: Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a moment to write down in paragraph or point form some of your reactions to what you have read. Apply it to your practice.\n\nWhen you interact with your clients or in your place of work, do you see psychology and your faith as two separate entities?\nDo you feel comfortable bringing your faith into your work (when it is ethically appropriate)?\nDoes your work challenge your faith sometimes?\nDoes your faith challenge your work? At work do you place more value on science or on your faith?",

    "section": "6.2 Clinical Implications",
    "text": "6.2 Clinical Implications\nOur next step will be to investigate the implications for the therapy room of the approaches described above. As part of this course we will read from the book Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (Johnson, 2012). The sections that explain how each view might apply in a therapist’s work are available to you as PDFs. The clinical case study of Jake will be incorporated into each view.\nIt is important to note before we begin that regardless of the integration approach that you choose for your own practice (if you choose one at all), as therapists it is our ethical duty to never bring up faith in the room unless the client indicates that they are interested. Critical Issues in Human Services, a course that we offer in SOCI 400, focuses on this subject. We will discuss this ethical consideration in more detail if you have not taken this course yet. As a Christian therapist or agency, we must respect the autonomy of the client (the ethical principle) and never assume that this is exactly what the client is seeking.\n\n6.2.1 Activity: Read | Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches, pp. 60–64, 72–74, and 81\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease refer to the reading provided for an example of how the levels of explanation view would look in a therapy room. It can be difficult to determine how each of the five approaches will affect the way we work, which is why Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (Johnson, 2012) addresses this issue. By providing these examples, it is hoped that the knowledge will be better integrated into practice.\n\nCounseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (2012)\nLesson 2: Levels of Explanation & Christian Counselors in Secular Contexts (2021) (2021b)\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter completing the activities above consider the following questions:\n\nWhat are the different levels the authors use to describe what is happening with Jake?\nWhat do the authors think should be prioritized or “triaged”?\nWhat are some of the strategies in the four areas or levels that are suggested?\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Activity: Read | Counseling and Christianity, Five Approaches, pp. 84–90, 95–99, and 107–108\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a look at the reading provided to see how an integration view would appear in the therapy room. It is sometimes difficult to imagine how each of the five approaches would affect the way we work, and this is precisely why Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (Johnson, 2012) was written. Hopefully, these examples will help you to solidify how this knowledge is applied.\n\nCounseling and Christianity, Five Approaches (2012)\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter reading, consider the following questions:\n\nWhat does the author believe that is needed for integration?\nWhat are the three legs of the tripod?\nDescribe the role of sanctification in the therapy process as the author sees it.\nWhat are the three views of the Imago Dei and what are the implications for counselling?\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Activity: Read | A Christian Psychology Approach, pp. 110–113 and 129–130\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee how a Christian psychology approach would manifest in the therapy room by reading the following. It can be challenging to recognize how each of the five approaches would impact the way in which we work; this is why Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (Johnson, 2012) was written. It is hoped that these concrete examples will help solidify how knowledge is applied in practice.\n\nCounseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (2012). A Christian Psychology Approach.\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter reading, consider the following questions:\n\nWhy is it paramount for the therapist to be rooted deeply in both God and his Word?\nWhat do the authors believe that true Christian psychology is based on?\nWhat is vital if therapy is to be totally Christian?\nHow should Christ in the room be seen according to these authors?\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.4 Activity: Read | Counseling and Christianity, Five Approaches, pp. 135, 140–142, 144, and 154\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following section, the authors do not provide a clear-cut way of discussing implications for the therapy room. As a result, they grapple with areas that may have been overlooked, and present a nuanced interpretation. The intention of this section is to provide you with as much information as possible about the transformational approach that we have been reading about.\n\nCounseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (2012). A Transformational Approach.\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter reading, consider the following questions:\n\nWhat are John Coe and Todd Hall’s four areas of incorporation of the spiritual into treatment models?\nWhat are the six ways the authors incorporate spiritual concepts and formation into their work?\nWhat type of informed consent document is it assumed that Jake will receive?\nWhat are the authors’ primary presuppositions of Jake?\nWhat is the distinction between counselling and spiritual direction, and what have the authors come to believe is the actual distinction between the two?\nWhat are the two areas to work in for the client?\nWhat should a therapist be dually trained in?\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.5 Activity: Read | Counseling and Christianity, Five Approaches, pp. 157–162 and 181\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the resources provided to see how the Biblical counselling approach will play out in a therapy session. It is difficult to see how each of the five approaches would influence how we work, so that is precisely the purpose of Counseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (Johnson, 2012). It is hoped that these tangible examples will assist in solidifying how the knowledge is applied in practice.\n\nCounseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (2012). A Biblical Counselling Approach.\n\nQuestions to Consider\nAfter reading, consider the following questions:\n\nWhat are the foundational beliefs that all counsellors enter into the room with?\nWhat are five key suppositions going into the counselling room?\nWhat must be in place (what must Jake have) in order for Biblical counselling to take place?\nWhy is the Church an important part of the recovery process?\nWhat two components must be taken into account in order to address and interact with Jake as a whole person?\nWhat is Tripp’s (2002) description of Biblical counselling?\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.6 Activity: Read | Summary, pp. 187–191\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis unit contains a lot of repetition; if you have difficulty understanding the differences between the five approaches, please refer to the summary PDF file available in the unit resources.\n\nCounseling and Christianity: Five Approaches (2012)\nSummary",

    "text": "6.3 Application\nIn this section you will begin to form your own ideas about how integration applies to your own life and your work with others. We may not spend a great deal of time discussing this area of our lives, but it can have significant implications if we do not. How do you view human nature? How do you view behaviours? What about mental health? What about research or science? What are your main values and how do you tangibly demonstrate them? As psychologists, our research and views have historically been perceived as misaligned with Christian beliefs. How do we reconcile these differences? Do you still believe this to be the case? What parts do you agree with or disagree with? If there are disagreements, why?\nHaving a framework of understanding is crucial as it informs how you present yourself and what you do. In EFFT, we have learned that when the internal experience does not match the external experience, alarm bells should sound. This is the case when you hold a certain set of values and these do not match up with the type of work you are performing. It is difficult to live with such incongruity. It is possible that we are not even aware that this is occurring.\nIn this unit and for this section, the goal is to define your values, beliefs, and how you will approach the subject. Even if you are not a Christian, everyone has their own set of values and beliefs, and it is imperative to recognize that even though you are on an ever-changing journey, these are some core beliefs you hold on to. These thoughts will be stimulated by the following activity.\n\n6.3.1 Activity: Optional Case Study\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease select the viewpoint or approach that you feel most comfortable with and most drawn to for this activity. After reading the following case study, write down how you would begin to approach it. Please consider the following questions:\n\nWhat is my view of the client?\nWhat integration style will I use? How will this inform my sessions? What will I focus on?\nHow can I use EFFT in combination with my style (knowing that EFFT is an evidence-based treatment model)?\n\nCase Study\n\nSandra (31) makes an appointment to speak with her therapist. She and her husband of six years have been active leaders in a thriving church ministry. Her story begins with her decision to step back from all ministry responsibilities due to ‘personal issues.’ Life is crowded with too many demands, and the timing is ripe to reassess even worthwhile commitments. Initially she is hesitant to reveal more.\nThe therapist responds by thoughtfully emphasizing how she and her husband have contributed to the discipleship of so many as the home Bible study they direct is a source of solid Christian teaching and revitalizing fellowship. He agrees to pray with her about being sensible and strategic about family priorities. After Sandra hears his perspective on her valuable contribution, her disclosure goes further. One month ago to the day, Sandra miscarried for the second time, something few people know. She admits that this is impacting her entire life as she is keeping distant from all of her former friends, all of whom have children. She is beginning to envision what her life might be if she never has a child of her own. Sandra does not imagine that people in the church have any idea of her inner anguish, and if they did, she believes that each would cease to respect her as a follower of Jesus Christ.\nSandra’s presentation flows steadily with restrained emotion until the therapist inquires gently about the impact on her marriage. She becomes tearful, sobs intermittently and has difficulty putting full sentences together. The ragged explanation reveals that the marriage tension is high and conflicts intense. The most distressing alarm is the escalating rage in the arguments between Sandra and her husband. (Greggo & Sisemore, 2012)",

It should be noted however, that you are not obligated to choose one of the views and follow it in your own journey or practice. In processing and interacting with these views the goal is to begin your own journey of thinking about integration. This will enable you to establish a belief system regarding health and wellness. To reiterate, it is not expected that you will have all these views memorized or know what distinguishes them from each other. Instead, we will begin an internal and external dialog around this topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking Your Learning\n\n\n\nBefore you move on, you may want to check that you are able to:\n\nCompare and contrast the five approaches to counselling and faith\nDiscover and determine which approach best suits each student\nUnderstand the parameters of talking about faith and spirituality in the counselling room\nDiscuss one’s own faith journey and how it relates to their future profession",

    "text": "Assignment 1: Research Paper\nInstructions\nStudents can choose to expand on the topic that they were assigned for their class presentations and add three more research articles. OR they can pick a new topic and are still required to have 3 research articles. The topic of the paper will answer the question: How would you work with someone who is struggling with ‘your assigned topic’? I invite you to use one of your case conceptualization scenarios as an illustration/case study to incorporate into this paper. The paper will cover four main points:\nSample Thesis\nTrauma is a common mental health issue that appears in therapy and as such it is important for clinicians to be trauma-informed and therefore have a foundational knowledge of what trauma is, what the goal of therapy would be (what wellness would look like), and what evidence-based therapy approaches work effectively with trauma. This paper will begin to explore these topics and conclude with a personal reflection on the author’s approach to integration and how it relates to treating trauma.\nAssignment Criteria\nFor this assignment you will write a 10-12 page paper double spaced. This does not include your title page and reference pages.\nYour paper must include a minimum of three high-quality, academic, peer-reviewed sources (e.g., journal articles). You may also use the textbook and other good quality sources in addition, but these do not count as part of the three required sources. Research papers composed entirely of web-based research are not considered suitable as a term paper and will be graded accordingly. Use the APA Publication Manual 7th Edition as guidance for the structure of the paper, citations within the body of the paper, and construction of the reference list.\nAs per APA 7 guidelines, papers should:\nInclude a separate title page with the title of the paper, your name, student number and date along with the name of our institution (school), the course name and number. Include a separate list of references that begins on a new page (as per APA style guidelines be double-spaced with 1” margins, typed using a 12 pt. standard font (e.g., Times, Arial or Helvetica) and be left- justified.\nUse the same font throughout your paper (do not use different styles or sizes of font for title, headings, etc.). You do not need to write an abstract for this paper.\nSome Writing Tips",

    "text": "An explanation of what the topic is, how and why the topic develops, and how it shows up:\n\nYou are invited to use one of your case conceptualizations to illustrate your research findings.\nThe majority of the NEW research for your paper should be done in this section. This section should be the largest section in your paper.\n\nWhat are the preventative measures/what wellness looks like in this area:\n\nYou are invited to use one of your case conceptualizations in this area as a case study/example to draw on as you explore what preventative measures you would use or what wellness would look like. For example, if your character had access to these resources, what may have happened or what would wellness look like for this character?\n\nEvidenced based treatment directions/community resources to access:\n\nYou may use the information from your oral presentations here if it aligns.\nYou are also invited to once again use your case conceptualization here to describe your recommendations/treatment recommendations.\n\nWhat approach to therapy and integration are you drawn to and why\n\nYou may use your case conceptualization tool here once again to show how you would integrate your faith with this case and/or use some of your thoughts you formed from your Forum discussions.\nIf you are not a Christian, please still include this section and talk about how you would integrate your religion or worldview as we all have one regardless of our backgrounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow the APA 7 style guidelines for citing your sources in the text of your paper and formatting on your References page.\nUse quotes sparingly. For a paper of this length, 4-6 direct quotes is more than enough. Save quotes for when it is absolutely essential to preserve an author’s original wording. The paper should convey your own ‘voice’ as the author.\nAvoid paraphrasing too much. Paraphrasing can slip easily into plagiarism and also makes for a boring paper. Read this article for tips on avoiding inappropriate paraphrasing.\nWhen deciding how much of a study to describe, consider what elements of the study would persuade a reader of your point. For example, in most instances, knowing the number of subjects that were run in the study is not useful information. However, if the study is about a special subset of the population (e.g., AIDS patients), it would be useful to know if the research findings are based on results from 3 people or 30. In most instances, knowing the names of the scales that were administered is irrelevant to your point; even mentioning ALL of the surveys and results is often too much. Pick and choose the relevant aspects of the study design and findings. Don’t let your sources dictate how you write your paper. Remember your own logic or outline as you cite sources.\nGood writers are relentless revisers. Papers that have not been revised are easy to spot: they are unpolished, read like a first-draft and will never receive top marks. You will not receive an A grade without proof-reading your paper. Use spell and grammar check and it never hurts to have someone else read over your paper with a fresh set of eyes before submitting it.\nPlease include citations in your paper. This is a RESEARCH paper and as such you need to a. Demonstrate that you have done the research, b. You are not an expert in this field so you need to back up what you are saying with evidence, c. avoid plagiarism.\nDo not include references in your reference section that were not cited in your paper. This is called ‘padding your references’ and is not allowed. If there are references in your reference section that are not in your paper I will assume that you are plagiarising.\n\n\nGrading Rubric\nSubstance /20\nThe research paper provides evidence of critical thinking and analysis and synthesis of researched information throughout and presents a logical and persuasive argument. /2\nResearch sources are relevant, current, and credible.
