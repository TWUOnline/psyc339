### Activity 1.3: Optional reading | The Body Keeps the Score Chapter 3

If you plan to work with traumatized individuals, [The Body Keeps the Score, Chapter 3](TBKTS_Ch.3.pdf), is an excellent suggested resource for you.

**Highlights from the reading are described in the following paragraphs:**

One of their main findings through the study they conducted on examining the brain in MRI’s is that trauma is preverbal. While the research participants were having their brains scanned, they were also being triggered by their individual traumas. Through this scan they discovered that the Broca’s area of the brain (where speech resides) was shut down/dark. This is a major finding as it tells us that the connection between speech and what is happening is disconnected. Along the same lines, they discovered that when something happens to remind traumatized people of their trauma, their right brain responds as if the event was happening in the present while their left side of the brain is shut down which can block the realization that the event is not happening now. This is all experienced in the bodily felt sense. This therefore means that the experience of trauma itself can get in the way of talking about the trauma. This piece of information is so crucial to know as therapists as the process of change in the therapy room often involves talking.

Van der Kolk also describes trauma succinctly in this chapter. He describes trauma as something that happens to you that makes you so upset that it overwhelms you and there is nothing you can do to help yourself function in the face of the particular event. Trauma is how you respond to it.
