# Unit 2: Work with Addictions
![alttext](u2overview.jpg "Rusty paint")

&nbsp;

## Overview

This second unit will revolve around Gabor Mate's book, "In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts." This book offers a revolutionary and compassionate perspective on those who struggle with addictions. During the previous unit, we have been able to gain a strong understanding of how trauma affects the brain. This knowledge will complement our studies this week, as Gabor Mate famously said, “Don’t ask why the addiction, ask why the pain.”

Trauma is heavily connected to the development and maintenance of addictions and we will spend this unit exploring this connection further.

It is important to note that this can be a very difficult and emotional topic to explore depending on your own personal history and that of those who are close to you. Throughout this learning process, I encourage you to take care of yourself if this topic is triggering for you. If necessary, take breaks, make sure you have ample time before and after you study the information, or schedule an appointment with a therapist or a friend in order to process some of what you encounter.

1. What is addiction?
