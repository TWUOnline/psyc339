### Activity 2.9: Reading | EFFT Chapters 2-3 & pages 153-154

According to Chapter 19 in Gabor Mate's book, there are many things that one cannot control, such as genetic makeup, temperament, where one is born, etc. Thus, it is important to focus on things that can be controlled.

Two areas are highlighted by EFFT: family environment and emotional processing. This diagram provides a good visual and was created by Adele LaFrance and Natasha Files (2018) for presentation purposes.

As we learned in our previous unit, Gabor Mate also emphasizes the importance of caregivers and community in the recovery process, which fits well with the EFFT model that emphasizes parental and caregiver involvement in mental health issues. Family environment and emotional processing are the two areas we can 'control', and if we work on both, the healing process will be extremely powerful.

!! During class you will be doing an activity  that revolves around the skill of emotion coaching/validation, so make sure you read Chapter 2 and 3.
