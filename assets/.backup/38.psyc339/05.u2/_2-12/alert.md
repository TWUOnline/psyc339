### Activity 2.12: Validation Exercise

For this activity, read Chapter 4 of the book “In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts”.
You will practice how to write a proper validation statement to explain why Serena has been using and continues to use, or if you would like you can write a validation statement to explain her inability to see her own inner strength and innate perfection. Most likely, these will sound too scripted and strange, but this is an integral part of the learning process.

**This exercise can be broken down into two steps:**

To begin with, it would look something like this...

- _No wonder/It makes sense why you continue to use because…. because… because…_

or

- _It makes sense to me why you would be struggling with seeing your own inner strength and value because… because… because…_

Then make sure you add the second part of the emotional support and then practical support.

- _I want you to know that…_
- _Why don’t we start by…_

There are examples in the Behavior Coaching section of the EFFT manual that are similar to Serena's situation.
