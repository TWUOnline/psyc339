### Activity 2.7: Optional Website Exploration | Brain Imaging with Dr. Amen

On the Amen Clinics website, you will find information on addiction and how they use brain imaging to identify what type of addict a person is. Despite the fact that this presentation of addiction is based on a medical model rather than a therapeutic model, it is valuable information nonetheless. You should keep scrolling down- sometimes it seems as though there is no additional information to be reviewed, but there is.
