## Topic 2: Stress and Resilience

The purpose of this section is to discuss how and why stress occurs, and how we can enhance our resilience to minimize stress; that is, as Daniel Siegel explains, by increasing our awareness, we will be able to handle things with less impact when they occur; despite the fact that they may still affect us, they will not have the same negative impact.
