### Activity 5.6: Read | Stress Management and Prevention - Chapter 2

In this chapter, we will examine how stress manifests in the body and how our body responds to stress. We should note that this is a continuation or a parallel from our previous learning about trauma. You are not expected to memorize all of the details or remember all of the parts of the body. This article is intended to give you a general understanding of how stress affects the body and how it can manifest itself.

Read p.30 to end of chapter. Please pay particular attention to pages 36-37 and observe how they are aligned with our understanding of EFFT. The Questions to consider section will be based on the Key Questions in the chapter. By reading these ahead of time, you will be able to guide your reading.
