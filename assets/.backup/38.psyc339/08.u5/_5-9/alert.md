### Activity 5.9: Optional Watch | The Power of Vulnerability - Bren√© Brown

Brown has spent the past two decades studying courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy at the University of Texas at Austin McCombs School of Business. Five of her books are New York Times bestsellers.

Please watch this clip from Brene Brown, who is well known for her work on vulnerability, shame, courage, and their relationship to resilience before starting the EFFT exercises/reading. It is likely that you have heard Brene Brown speak before, but I encourage you to listen to her again and consider how working on shame/vulnerability/courage can also cultivate resilience within you while working in the therapy room. This is her first TED talk that is well known to most people; it captured the attention of the nation.
