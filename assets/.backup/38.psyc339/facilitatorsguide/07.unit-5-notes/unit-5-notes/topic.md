# Unit 5: Work with Stress and Resilience


Read the Unit 5 overview, unit learning outcomes, topics, activity checklist, and assessments in Moodle to familiarize yourself with student workload expectations.

&nbsp;

### Synchronous Portion

In the synchronous portion of this class, I would like you to facilitate a discussion around self care and what role they see stress playing in their lives, how they manage it and what are some strategies to manage stress. In all professions it is important to manage stress well, but particularly in this profession it has the potential to become an ethical issue if the stress is affecting your work with your client. Draw on the learning from this unit to enhance the discussion, particularly around how to ‘safeguard’ yourself from stress high-jacking you and how to build up resilience.

Spend some time going over activity 5.11 (The case study) in class; review the answers and invite discussion around how to interact with this case study as if they were your client.

Leave some time to go over any last minute questions on the paper, remind them that their oral presentations are supposed to be uploaded by today and that their one question and comment (completed in Microsoft streams) should be done in this next week.

### Learning Activities and Assignment
For this course, there are very few activities that need to be completed. The readings for this course are taken from a variety of resources and it is important for students to experience gaining information/insight from a variety of resources as this will hopefully help them understand and shape them for their final paper. The instructions for each activity are written in Moodle.

**Activity 5.1: The Father’s of Stress and Resilience**
The purpose of this activity is to learn about General Adapation Syndrome which is a core model in viewing stress. The ‘father of stress’ Hans Seyle will be introduced. Garmenzy is the ‘father’ of resilience and we will also be reading a couple of pages on where the concept of resilience originated from providing students with more of a history.

**Activity 5.2: Read Chapter 1, “The Meaning of Stress” (Stress Management and Prevention)**
The purpose of this activity is to explore how stress is defined and what it is. This book provides a very good introduction and some thoughtful questions that will help in the students’ learning journey.

**Activity 5.3: Optional Reflection | Table 1.3 For Reflection**
The purpose of this activity is to provide students with the space, after they have learned about what stress is, to reflect on how stress shows up in their own lives and influences their day to day. This is the reflective integrative piece. This is an optional activity for students.

**Activity 5.4: What is Resilience?**
The purpose of this activity is to provide an introduction to what resiliency is and what it does.

**Activity 5.5: Watch the Daniel Siegel Clips**
The purpose of this activity is to learn more about resiliency from Daniel Siegel, a prominent research on interpersonal neurobiology. His research focuses on the importance of resilience and how we can build it in ourselves and in our children. The second clip dives into how to create resilience between a parent and child and what building those circuits look like.

**Activity 5.6: Read Chapter 2 (Stress Management and Prevention)**
The purpose of this next activity is to explore how stress develops and what impact it has on the brain and potentially the long term effects that it can have on our bodies as well.

**Activity 5.7: An Illustration**
The purpose of this next activity is to hear about an example of how stress can physically affect someone to the point of mortality. Gabor Mate shares a musical idol’s life story that he had written about in his book “The Body Keeps the  Score”.

**Activity 5.8: Read the Article**
The purpose of this activity is to read an article on how resilience affects development of children and the importance of building this in our kids. Gordon Neufeld is another popular researcher in the field of parenting and resilience building.

**Activity 5.9: Optional Activity | Watch the Clip**
The purpose of this activity is to connect the power of sharing emotions to building up resilience. This will set the stage for the importance of doing EFFT with this kind of work. This is an optional activity for students.

**Activity 5.10: Watch the Clip**
The purpose of this activity is to once again look at what Daniel Seigel has to say on this topic as he is a strong advocate for doing the work with our children to build this up in them.

**Activity 5.11: Case Study**
The purpose of this next activity is to practice our EFFT skills in reference to validating the stressful moments in our lives and in the process building up resiliency to generalize our ability to interact with intense emotions throughout the rest of the areas in our lives.
