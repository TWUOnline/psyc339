# Unit 3: Work with Grief, Loss and Death

Read the Unit 3 overview, unit learning outcomes, topics, activity checklist, and assessments in Moodle to familiarize yourself with student workload expectations.

&nbsp;

### Synchronous Portion
In the synchronous portion of this class, take some time to ask students what their thoughts on death/dying/grieving were before reading the class material and how they have interacted with this topic in the past. Growing up, were they exposed to death? Has their family grieved openly? Did they receive any specific messages? What were the messages they received regarding the afterlife? How did they find interacting with the course material?

Spend some time going over the EFFT exercises in Topic 3 and answer any questions the students may have.

Make sure that you cover the requirements for their final paper in this class. There will most likely be a lot of questions so make sure that you leave enough time to cover the questions. As another reminder, make sure you take time to explain what a research paper entails as this may be new learning for some.

### Learning Activities and Assignment
For this course, there are a number of activities that you will be required to complete. The readings for this course are taken from a variety of resources and it is important for students to experience gaining information/insight from a variety of resources as this will hopefully help them understand and shape them for their final paper. The instructions for each activity are written in Moodle.

**Activity 3.1: Watching the following Clips**
The purpose of this activity is to gain an understanding of the process of grief, what dying physically looks like and what really matters in the end. Students will be watching video clips from some of the prominent researchers and spokes people in this field. This is meant to be an introduction for the unit.

**Activity 3.2: Read On Death and Dying p. 37-53, 76-86, 105-117, 132**
The purpose of this activity is to get to know Elizabeth Kubler Ross who was a pioneer in the field of hospice care, caring for those who were dying and helping them walk through this stage of life. She is famous for developing the stages of grief and her work is used everywhere.

**Activity 3.3: Optional Read “Experiencing Grief” by H. Norman Wright**
The purpose of this activity is to explore an integrated text on grief and how God shows up in the journey. The whole book will be required to be read, however it is short and not academic so it should be easy to digest. This is an optional activity for students.

**Activity 3.4: To Explore**
The purpose of this activity is to provide students with the opportunity to access further resources on grief. Students can choose to explore or not, the hope of this activity is to provide them with resources in case they encounter this and are wondering where to go for support.  

**Activity 3.5: Read the following article**
The purpose of this activity is to provide the students with three models of grieving/change that can occur after a person passes away. The author of this article uses her own story of grief to illustrate what the process and each stage could be like.

**Activity 3.6: Read “Being Mortal’ Chapter 1: The Independent Self.**
The purpose of this activity is to expand the conversation around death and to focus for a moment on how society as a whole views and treats the elderly and how that has affected and influenced our views on death and how we deal with it.

**Activity 3.7: Read Chapter 2 in “Being Mortal”**
The purpose of this activity is to get into more specifics around medically what happens to the body before death and how the ‘wear and tear’ affects us and how modern medicine has created different trajectories for death and how that then can take us by surprise.

**Activity 3.8: Complicated/Complex Grief**
The purpose of this activity is to do some self reflection and experientially go through the Complex grief inventory. You can emphasize to students that they don’t need to complete this, especially if they have recently gone through a huge loss.

**Activity 3.9: Read the article**
The purpose of this activity is to draw our attention to the way that different religions handle and process death. This can also open up a conversation in class around specific cultural practices, but this article focuses specifically on different religious practices and how these can provide comfort in a time of great turmoil.

**Activity 3.10: Review EFFT Chapters 1-2, READ chapter 5**
The purpose of this activity is to review the EFFT concepts in the first two chapters and then to read chapter 5 which will provide the students with information around ‘blocks’ and how important it is for them to be addressed when it comes to figuring out why we can’t talk about certain topics or address certain issues. This activity also provides the opportunity for more practice and asks students to look at their own blocks and then create a validation statement around why it makes sense that they are there.

**Activity 3.11: Optional Read “Walking with God through Pain and Suffering” by Timothy Keller**
The purpose of this activity is to draw student’s attention to the theology of suffering and pain and to begin to reconcile how God’s love can be present at the same time as the experience of pain and suffering. This can be a block for some when the experience of death or dying has come up. This is an optional activity for students.
