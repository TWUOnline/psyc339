### Activity 6.12: Read | Counselling and Christianity pg. 60-64 & 72-74 & 81 - PDF

Please refer to the pdf provided for an example of how the 'Levels of Explanation View' would look in a therapy room. It can be difficult to determine how each of the five approaches will affect the way we work, which is why the book Counselling and Christianity: Five Approaches addresses this issue. By providing these examples, it is hoped that the knowledge will be better integrated into practice.

### Questions to Consider

After the reading, consider the following questions:

1. What are the different levels the author uses to describe what is going on for Jake?
2. What does the author think should be prioritized or ‘triaged’?
3. What are some of the strategies in the four areas/levels that are suggested?
