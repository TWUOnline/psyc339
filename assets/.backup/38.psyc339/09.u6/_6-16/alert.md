### Activity 6.16: Read |  A Biblical Counselling Approach p. 157-162 & 181

Take a look at the pdf file provided to see how the "Biblical Counselling Approach" will play out in a therapy session. It is difficult to see how each of the five approaches would influence how we work, and this is precisely the purpose of Counselling and Christianity: Five Approaches. It is hoped that these tangible examples will assist in solidifying how the knowledge is applied in practice.
