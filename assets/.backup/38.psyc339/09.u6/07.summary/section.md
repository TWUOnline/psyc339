## Unit 6 Summary

You have learned about five views of integration and have begun thinking about what integration might look like for you in this sixth unit. In addition, it should be noted that you are not obligated to choose one of the views and follow it in your own journey or practice. In processing and interacting with these views, the goal is to begin your own journey of thinking about integration. This will enable you to establish a belief system regarding health and wellness. To reiterate, it is not expected that you will have all these views memorized or know what distinguishes them from each other. Instead, we will begin an internal and external dialog around this topic.
