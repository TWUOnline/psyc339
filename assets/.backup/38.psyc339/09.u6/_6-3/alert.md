### Activity 6.3: Watch “An Integration View”
<!--
**“An Integration View”**
Here is a short summary of what 'An Integration View' is; hopefully this will help guide your reading, along with the 'questions to consider'.

According to the Integration View, we are responsible for living out our faith in every aspect of our lives. We are responsible for relying on God's divine and natural revelations for all of our beliefs and practices. This view does not oppose science or research, but holds that God can reveal himself through natural revelation through scientific research. This very brief description will be expanded upon in the reading.

“Integration is a recursive process of expanding understanding, but always with our most fundamental loyalty being to the true teachings of the special revelation of the Bible. Integration is ultimately the task of the Christian person whom God has led to be a student or scholar of some facet of psychology, with the true teachings of special revelation as the guiding framework for how that person structures his or her deepest beliefs and loyalties.” p.117

Before you begin to engage in the clip, here is a little synopsis of what ‘An Integration View’ is; hopefully this will help guide your reading along with the ‘questions to consider’.
The Integration View holds that we are responsible to live out our faith in all aspects of our lives and to trust in God’s divine and natural revelation to determine all of our beliefs and practices. This view does not go against science or research but holds to the idea that ‘all truth is God’s truth’ and God can reveal himself through natural revelation by means of scientific research.
This view calls strong integrationists to really study the word, study christian integration and study psychology. This video talks about how the danger of integration is that many therapists don’t receive training in integration and then often become more ‘secularized’ in the process.
