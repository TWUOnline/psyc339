## Unit 4 Summary

You have learned about three different major mental health issues in this fourth unit, depression, suicidality, and eating disorders. As part of this unit, you have learned what a mental health issue is, why it occurs, and how it can be dealt with considering the resources available. Additionally, you have practiced with case scenarios. Having acquired a broad understanding of each mental health issue, you will be prepared to begin validating these very difficult conditions. In the event that you were triggered or stirred up in any way by this unit's discussions, I encourage you to take care of yourself and seek out someone to talk to as well as implement any other grounding techniques you find helpful.
