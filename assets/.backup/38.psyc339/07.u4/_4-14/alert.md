### Activity 4.14: Read |  Eating Disorders and Generational influences

As part of the EFFT curriculum, we are taught that families have a profound impact on treatment outcomes. In order to illustrate this point, I selected the following article.

Brun, I., Russell-Mayhew, S., & Mudry, T. (2021). Last Word: Ending the intergenerational transmission of body dissatisfaction and disordered eating: a call to investigate the mother-daughter relationship. Eating Disorders, 29(6), 591–598. [https://doi-org.twu.idm.oclc.org/10.1080/10640266.2020.1712635](https://doi-org.twu.idm.oclc.org/10.1080/10640266.2020.1712635)

### Questions to consider

1. What is a predictor of subclinical and clinical eating disorders?
2. What do mothers act as and why is that important?
3. How can eating disorders be influenced directly and indirectly?
4. Did endorsing lower body satisfaction motivate girls to engage in healthful habits? Why or why not?
5. What is the ‘call to action?’ What do they recommend?
