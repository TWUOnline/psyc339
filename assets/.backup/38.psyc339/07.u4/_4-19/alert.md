### Activity 4.19: EFFT and Eating Disorders

It has been shown in the literature that parental body image (in particular, a mother's) and eating habits can be associated with the manifestation of an eating disorder in their loved one. Note that this is a correlation and not a causation. This is important for relieving caregiver self blame and to then empower a caregiver/parent to become a part of the healing process. There is evidence to support the benefits of caregiver involvement in the literature we have been reading.

If a caregiver has struggled or continues to struggle with an eating disorder or body dysmorphia, this may hinder their ability to participate in the healing process of their loved one.
