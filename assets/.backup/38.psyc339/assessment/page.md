# Course Evaluation

|Assignment |Activity |Value |Due |
|-----------|---------|-------|----------|
|Research Paper | Pick a topic and research | 35% | A week after the last class|
|Forum Discussion Participation (only top 5 will be counted towards your grade) | Each session participation | 25% | Each Unit|
|Oral Presentation | Pre-recorded presentations | 20% | Unit 5 |
|Case Conceptualizations (only need to pick 3 out of the 6) | Report | 20% | Dependent on Cases chosen |

### The Structure of the Assignments

Please note that each of the assignments build on each other. The Forums will help you formulate your thoughts and interact with the material on a personal level, the Case Conceptualizations will help you start to apply the material to different situations. The Oral presentations will require you to research in more depth a treatment modality and then the paper will incorporate all of these pieces. You are encouraged to then thoughtfully plan out your assignments. For example one of your case conceptualizations that you choose should be connected to the topic that you will choose for your research paper. The same will apply for your oral presentations. Then when you write your paper, you will have already done some research you need and will already have a case conceptualization that you have reasoned through to include in your paper. For the personal section of the paper, you will also already have started wrestling through some of the reflections/questions in your Forums. The more time and intention you spend on these assignments, the easier your final paper will be to put together.

You will find the instructions, specific due dates and submission boxes for each of these assessments in the nested tabs above.

### Academic Integrity and Avoiding Plagiarism at TWU

As scholars pursuing higher education, academic integrity is a core value of the entire TWU community. Students are invited into this scholarly culture and required to abide by the principles of sound academic scholarship at TWU. This includes, but is not limited to, avoiding all forms of plagiarism and cheating in scholarly work. TWU has a strict policy on plagiarism (see [policy below). Learning what constitutes plagiarism and avoiding it is the student's responsibility. Two resources describing plagiarism and how to avoid it have been prepared by TWU Librarian William Badke and are freely available for viewing [**here**](https://vimeo.com/163566887/bece097c99).

!! It will be assumed that you have read, understand, and agree to the information provided at the 'Academic Dishonesty Policy' button below. If you have any questions at all please contact your instructor.

### Artificial Intelligence Policy

It is vitally important that you understand the purpose of your Christian Liberal arts university education at TWU. In order to equip you to think truthfully, act justly, and live faithfully for the good of the world and the glory of God, we know that you must grow in your ability to engage in genuine critical thinking, generate original work, and express your own ideas in an organized and clear manner. Quite simply, generative AI tools can shortcut that process. We urge you to avoid thinking of your education as transactional (produce something, get a grade, get a degree) and instead consider it as transformational (helping you to become a better human being).

At the same time, we also understand that we are preparing you for a life and career after graduation wherein the use of generative AI tools will become more commonplace. To that end, we hope to guide you toward its use in ethical ways that do not shortcut the overall purpose of your education but rather enhance it.

Your responsibility is to ensure that you understand the ethical and legalissues inherent in the use of these tools, avoid the use of any tool that shortcuts the learning process, and pay close attention to the expectations that each of your professors has based on the learning outcomes for each course that you take at TWU. If anything is unclear, please ask.

#### Professor Expectations of AI Usage

AI usage in this class is limited to the following:

1. Using AI to come up with a list of resources and articles that pertain to your assignment.
2. Wording or grammar on a couple of sentences throughout your assignments. Please do not do entire paragraphs. AI is not creative and will regurgitate the same paragraphs across students’ assignments. This is also considered plagarism as this is not your writing.
3. Help in fixing citation errors or generating reference pages. You are responsible that the citation is correct as sometimes the AI doesn’t do a good job of this.
4. Please do not use any AI for Forum postings or for your case conceptualizations

**Protocol if AI usage is suspected:**

1. Professor will issue a warning and an opportunity to redo the assignment which will need to be done within 24 hours otherwise it will be given a 0 on the assignment. There will be no extensions granted as there has been a warning issued to not use AI.
2. If the assignment is not fixed within the 24 hour period, professor will reach out to the Dean and further action may be taken other than a zero on the assignment.
