### Activity 3.7: Read | “Being Mortal’ Chapter 2

The purpose of this chapter is to describe the various trajectories our lives can take and what will occur to our bodies in these scenarios. Furthermore, this chapter explores the priorities we have in our culture, in particular those related to dying and aging, and how, despite the fact that there are ways to be properly supported in our elder years, we do not prioritize it enough to bring about this change. This chapter is important for us to read as I am hoping it stimulates some thoughts about how we deal with the elderly and ultimately with death; how our avoidance of talking about aging and death may be preventing us from receiving the appropriate care at this time of our lives.

Becoming more comfortable with talking about death is not only beneficial for us psychologically, but also biologically. In order to contribute to the continuing of this conversation, Atul Gwande's book is a worthwhile and necessary read. I urge all of you to read the remainder of it when you have the time.

### Questions to Consider

1. Why is it that even though a diagnosis can be present for a long time, death can still come as a surprise?
2. What two revolutions have the advances of modern medicine given us?
3. Why is studying aging, studying an unnatural process?
4. What is the condition known as frailty?
5. Why did the doctor say you must always examine the feet of an elderly person?
6. What did the University of Minnesota study? Why was the center shut down?
