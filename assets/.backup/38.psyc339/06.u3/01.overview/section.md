# Unit 3: Work with Grief, Loss and Death

![alttext](u3overview.jpg "girl with tear")

&nbsp;

## Overview

In this unit we will spend some time discussing a subject that we tend to avoid; death accompanied by grieving. Grieving can be challenging in a culture that often ignores loss and avoids discussing its impact, as H. Norman Wright points out at the start of his book, which you’ll have the opportunity to read later in this unit. “When we add this silence to the fact that most of us have never been taught about the process and normalcy of grief and death, no wonder we struggle” (p. 1).

Our fear and pain surrounding death are intensified by the uncertainty it brings, raising questions that lack definitive answers. For those with faith, this belief can provide some comfort—a sense of peace about what comes after death. However, this comfort does not eliminate the pain of losing a loved one, the suffering that may precede death, or the lingering questions and anxieties that often accompany it. As we’ve discussed in earlier units, the experience of suffering and pain is something we naturally strive to avoid at all costs.

As with the previous unit, this one also deals with trauma. In the same way that death can cause trauma to the body, it can cause suffering to the brain of those who are left behind as well. This unit will not go into detail about how the brain is affected, but keep in mind what you learned from the first unit about trauma and the brain.
