## Topic 3: How do We Work with It?

Recent research suggests that grief does not necessarily follow the linear, predictable stages once widely accepted. However, it remains broadly understood that grief is a process aimed at recovering meaning after a loss (Brown, 2021). The risk factors for complicated grief are diverse, including depression, anxiety, poor physical health, attachment issues, low perceived social support, family conflict near the end of life, and difficulty accepting death. Understanding these factors can help guide the appropriate support needed.

There is no doubt that there is a great deal of information available regarding grief management. We will be spending most of our time in this section gaining a greater understanding of EFFT.

During this topic you will have the opportunity to increase your knowledge on how to work with grief. You have read in previous sections about some suggested models to work with grief. Grief can also be approached and modelled in many other ways. In preparation for your Oral Presentation, you will have the opportunity to research some treatment models.
