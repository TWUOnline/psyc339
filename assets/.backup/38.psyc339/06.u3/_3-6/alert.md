### Activity 3.6: Read | “Being Mortal’ Chapter 1: The Independent Self.

Atul Gwande's book "Being Mortal" is a great resource for you to examine how our views of the elderly have shifted in our culture, starting with the first chapter. It is my hope that you will come back to this reading when you have the time, as the entire book presents important viewpoints on the topic.

Death/dying is not explicitly discussed in Chapter 1, but how we view the elderly is important as our avoidance of interacting with elderly people and thinking about this stage of our lives is arguably a result of avoiding thinking about our own deaths.

### Questions to Consider

1. How does the way contemporary society treat their elderly compare to how the elderly are treated in most of human history?
2. What are the 8 “Activities of Daily Living” and the 8 “Independent Activities of Daily Living?”
3. How does new technology change the way we treat our elderly?
4. Describe the shift from elderly living/needing to live with family to the creation of the ‘retirement’ phase.
5. Finish the following quote, “Modernization did not demote the elderly. It demoted the _________” p.22
6. What has the veneration of elders been replaced with?
