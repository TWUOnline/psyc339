### Activity 3.11: Optional Reading | “Walking with God through Pain and Suffering” by Timothy Keller

The book written by Timothy Keller is an excellent resource for those interested in learning more about theology of suffering and pain. The only section that pertains to our topic today will be read. Despite the fact that he is primarily discussing pain and suffering, his words are applicable to our discussion on grief, loss, and death, as they are also engulfed in worlds of pain and suffering.

**Please read Chapter 11 which you can find here.**

### Questions to Consider

1. What is the main metaphor describing how to experience pain and suffering and what is the idea behind it?
2. What is the difference between being in the fire versus having the fire within yourself?
3. What is the metaphor of the mixed gold?
4. What is the paradoxical balance of confidence and humility in the response of Shadrach, Meschach and Abednego?
5. We have been exploring how experiencing pain, loss, death, and suffering change you and open us up to access a deeper place within, how does Tim Keller expand on this discussion?
6. How does Tim Keller frame ‘the furnace’? How does he recommend viewing being in the furnace?

By inviting you to read this chapter, I hope to initiate a discussion regarding how God views our pain, our suffering, and our losses. The presence of death is accompanied by the presence of pain. The following are three 'takeaways' from this chapter:

1. When suffering, pain, death and loss are present, God uses these experiences to deepen us, to draw us closer to Him and to shape us in the process.
2. When we are in the depths of despair and we cry out to God, our call is not to simply believe enough and then God will answer our prayers. Our call is to put our trust primarily in God and His wisdom and not our own. There is a surrender in this process which is extremely hard to do. Going through the stages of grief or taking time to work on oneself may need to occur before this can happen.
3. Jesus was thrown in the ultimate fire for you and experienced this process completely on His own. In knowing this, can you trust him with your small fires?

**Read Chapter 12: Weeping**
We can apply the concepts from this chapter to all of our units so far as well as our units to come. As scripture tells us, there is a time for everything; a time for weeping and despair is included in this and Tim Keller expands on the importance of weeping for healthy emotional development as well as a means for drawing us closer to God.

### Questions to Consider

1. Why did Christians feel the need to eliminate lamenting?
2. How did God respond to Elijah during his time of suffering? Who did God send?
3. What does creating a climate of care do?
4. What are the three lessons that the psalms teach us?
5. How does weeping drive us into joy? How can we experience seemingly paradoxical emotions at the same time?
