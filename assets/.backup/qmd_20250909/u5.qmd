# Work with Stress and Resilience

## Overview {.unnumbered}

In Unit 5, both stress and resilience will be explored in detail. While these may appear to be distinct topics, they are deeply interconnected. Stress is an inevitable part of life, arising from various external and internal pressures, while resilience is the capacity to adapt and bounce back from these challenges. The relationship between the two is significant: the more resilient we become, the better we are at managing stress. Although stress will always exist, a resilient individual can approach it differently, viewing obstacles as opportunities for growth rather than insurmountable difficulties.
Resilience doesn’t eliminate stress, but it transforms the way we interact with it. With greater resilience, stressful situations are less likely to overwhelm us, and we develop healthier coping mechanisms. Instead of being paralyzed or drained by stress, resilience empowers us to stay grounded, think clearly, and respond effectively. Through building resilience, we gain the tools to reduce the impact of stress on our emotional, mental, and even physical well-being. In other words, by strengthening our resilience, we can significantly alter our experience of stress, making it less of a burden and more of a manageable part of our personal and professional lives.

## Stress and Resilience

Stress and its manifestation in the body are the topics we explore in Unit 5. As research shows, experiencing stress is detrimental to our bodies and our health in general. It is therefore very important to develop and expand our resilience in order to properly handle and interact with stress.

In the same manner as in previous units, I would like to acknowledge and hear from those who have contributed to the field of stress and resilience research. Although the scope of research has expanded since then, it is important to recall where we began.

### Activity: Video and Reading | The "Fathers of Stress and Resilience"

::: {.learning-activity}

**Dr. Hans Seyle**

In the world of stress management, Hans Selye is widely acknowledged as the "father of the field." As such, he is a Canadian resource for the rest of the world. Over 1700 scholarly papers and 39 books have been published since Dr. Selye published the first scientific paper to identify and define "stress" in 1936. His work was cited in more than 362,000 scientific papers and in countless popular magazine articles, in nearly every major language and in every country in the world at the time of his death in late 1982. There is no doubt that he is the most frequently cited author on stress issues in the world. Throughout a period of exposure to a nonspecific demand, Selye proposed that stress remains present in the individual's body. Among his distinctions, he called the cumulative effects of chronically applied stressors 'general adaptation syndrome,' also known as Selye's syndrome in the literature.

Dr. Selye is one of the founders of the Canadian Institute of Stress. You may wish to spend a few minutes exploring the following website: <https://stresscanada.org/>

To learn more about one of Dr. Hans Selye's major contributions to stress research, please watch the following video. Please note that the video is 4:01 minutes long.

**Questions to Consider**

After viewing the video, consider the following questions and use them as a tool to help you process the information.

1. What is General Adaptation Syndrome?
2. What is it better described as?
3. What is the HPA? How can it weaken?

**Norman Garmezy**

The resilience theory is regarded as the brainchild of Norman Garmezy, the ‘father’ of resilience theory. In addition to his work in developmental psychopathology, he was a professor of psychology. Garmezy held positions at Duke University (1950–1961) and the Institute of Child Development at the University of Minnesota (1961–1989) after receiving his doctorate from the University of Iowa in 1950. It was his early work that focused on schizophrenia etiology, but his later work focuses on child development risks, resilience, stress, and coping. We will spend some time getting to know his research, even though there have been more advances since his discoveries in the 1980s and 1990s.

We will be reading from Ann Masten’s book, [Ordinary Magic](assets/u5/Ordinary_Magic_Introduction.pdf){target="_blank"}.

Ann Masten is a prominent resilience researcher and professor of child development at the University of Minnesota. She is widely recognized for her work on resilience in children and how they thrive despite adversity. In her book Ordinary Magic, Masten explores the concept of resilience, arguing that it is not a rare, extraordinary trait but a common capacity that arises from ordinary human resources like supportive relationships, problem-solving skills, and community support. The book highlights the power of everyday systems that foster resilience in individuals facing challenges. Masten studied under Garmezy and take note of when he is mentioned.

## Stress and Resilience

The purpose of this section is to discuss how and why stress occurs, and how we can enhance our resilience to minimize stress; that is, as Daniel Siegel explains, by increasing our awareness, we will be able to handle things with less impact when they occur; despite the fact that they may still affect us, they will not have the same negative impact.

### Activity: Read | Stress Management and Prevention - Chapter 2

::: {.learning-activity}

In this chapter, we will examine how stress manifests in the body and how our body responds to stress. We should note that this is a continuation or a parallel from our previous learning about trauma. You are not expected to memorize all of the details or remember all of the parts of the body. This article is intended to give you a general understanding of how stress affects the body and how it can manifest itself.

Read p.30 to end of chapter. Please pay particular attention to pages 36-37 and observe how they are aligned with our understanding of EFFT. The Questions to consider section will be based on the Key Questions in the chapter. By reading these ahead of time, you will be able to guide your reading.

## Strategies for Dealing with Stress and Resilience

Being resilient means overcoming setbacks and challenges, such as losing a job, facing illness, experiencing a disaster, or grieving a loved one. These stressful events can lead people to unhealthy coping mechanisms, like substance abuse, eating disorders, or risky behaviors, which can make them feel stuck in their problems or victimized. While resilience doesn’t eliminate difficulties, it helps people look beyond them, find joy in life, and handle stress more effectively.

This is another opportunity for us to continue learning from EFFT. The goal is for you to have a reasonably good understanding of what validation entails by now. During this session, we will develop a validation statement and add a behaviour coaching component.

### Activity: Optional Video | The Power of Vulnerability - Brené Brown

::: {.learning-activity}

Brown has spent the past two decades studying courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy at the University of Texas at Austin McCombs School of Business. Five of her books are New York Times bestsellers.

Please watch this clip from Brene Brown, who is well known for her work on vulnerability, shame, courage, and their relationship to resilience before starting the EFFT exercises/reading. It is likely that you have heard Brene Brown speak before, but I encourage you to listen to her again and consider how working on shame/vulnerability/courage can also cultivate resilience within you while working in the therapy room. This is her first TED talk that is well known to most people; it captured the attention of the nation.

### Activity: Case Study

::: {.learning-activity}

Please refer back to the EFFT manual if you need any reminders on emotion coaching or behavior coaching.

---

In regards to stress and resilience specifically, I quote this text from our EFFT Manual:

“There is strong evidence to suggest that emotional intelligence (which includes emotion management, emotion perception, and emotion utilization) moderates the relationship between stress and mental health concerns in adolescents and adults, including depression, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation (Ciarrochi, Deane, & Anderson, 2002; Extremera & Fernandez-Berrocal, 2006). Taken together, these studies suggest that a focus on the development and refinement of emotion processing and regulation can serve to buffer against the experience of life stressors. For these reasons, the EFFT clinician also works with caregivers to equip them with the skills of emotion coaching to support their loved one’s wellness. Over time, their loved one develops self-efficacy with emotion processing-that is, the capacity and confidence to experience, tolerate, regulate, and  be guided by their emotions without need of maladaptive coping strategies. In addition to supporting in the moment emotion processing and the development of the capacity to self-regulate, emotion-coaching skills enhance treatment in various ways. As caregivers adopt this new style of relating to their loved one, their relationship will strengthen and their efforts to support their loved one with behavioral symptoms will be more effective and better received. As symptoms decrease, caregivers can also support their loved one to manage the flood of emotions that sometimes follow. This work will also provide loved ones with evidence of their caregiver’s capacity and willingness to support them with their emotional pain, making it more likely that they will turn to the caregiver for support in times of stress” (Lafrance, Henderson & Mayman, 2020).

---

Read the following Case Study and then spend some time creating a validation statement for this particular client. We will be emotion coaching this client and adding a ‘behavior intervention’ that will help the client to deal with their ongoing stress in their life. You may come up with your own ideas for what may help alleviate stress based on the class readings, your own experience, or you can also look up some suggestions if you would like. Note that you would do a lot more work than just this one emotion coaching before suggesting a way to cope. In real time, you really need to spend time in the validation with them really understanding what they are saying and conveying that you ‘get it’.

## Summary {.unnumbered}

In Unit 5, you have learned about Stress and Resilience. It is so important that we understand how prolonged stress can affect our bodies and how urgent it is to take action. The fact that we can build up our resilience tangibly should also encourage you. In the beginning, it is easier to do it when we are young, but it is also possible to do when we are older. Fortunately, the brain is very malleable and can still be taught and learned.
