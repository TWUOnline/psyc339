# Unit 2: Reason

In this unit, students are exposed to arguments. Students and the facilitator are not required to evaluate arguments or learn complicated logic. If they follow the instructions and practice the optional exercises in Moodle, those instructions and exercises should be sufficient to succeed on the logic assignment for Unit 2. The facilitator should (i) become familiar with the logic exercises and concepts; and (ii), help students understand that identifying arguments is valuable for living life well. Students are better positioned for life – e.g., their occupation and relationships – when they understand how arguments work.

### Learning Activities and Assignment
The learning activities are optional but should assist with helping students prepare for the Unit 2 assignment. The only graded assignment for Unit 2 is a logic test at the end of the Unit. This assignment is automated and so the facilitator needn’t grade the Unit 2 assignment. However, the facilitator must assign a date/time for the students to take that Unit 2 assignment (see tentative dates chart below)

### Unit 2 | Tips for instruction
The preamble for unit 2 should convey the importance of learning how to identify arguments. This can be done effectively by giving examples from politics, the media, and so on, where people rarely know or take the time to identify the argument in use – and, certainly, not often with charity. The preamble must also include directions for how to work through the exercises (see below) and a description of the Unit 2 assignment.

Students learn how to identify arguments effectively through practice and thus most of the class time during Unit 2 should be devoted to practice. That is why each topic in Unit 2 includes several practice exercises. Practice is especially important for topics 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6 because (i) those exercises slowly introduce students to complicated arguments, and (ii), those exercises introduce students to the format for the Unit 2 assignment.

One way for the facilitator to incorporate practice during class time (particularly for 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6) is to instruct the students to practice the first 5 exercises on their own (or in groups) for 5-10 min, then the facilitator reviews each of the exercises with the students. Repeat that process for the remainder of the exercises. In topics 2.5 and 2.6, the exercises are more challenging, and students may require more time to complete them. The idea is to give plenty of class time to practice and review.
