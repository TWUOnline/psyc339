The third topic focuses on wisdom and humility. Our previous two topics discussed the importance of knowledge when seeking wisdom. Nevertheless, even Descartes recognizes that knowledge in some domains is difficult to obtain. Plato believed that a wise person understands their limitations about what they know and do not know. In other words, **a wise person is aware of their ignorance**. The word "ignorance" in this case does not have a negative connotation, but rather describes a lack of knowledge about a particular thing.

In “the Apology,” Plato introduces the character Socrates, who is on trial for his life. During his defense, Socrates describes the account of his friend, Chaerephon, seeking answers from the Oracle of Delphi, wondering if there is any person wiser than Socrates. In reply to Chaerephon, the oracle says that no one is wiser than Socrates. Socrates is puzzled by the revelation about his wisdom since he considers himself to be unwise. Socrates then asks questions of different people in the city, such as politicians, poets, and artisans, in an attempt to solve the mystery about the oracle's revelation. Socrates discovers that while these individuals claim to know a great deal about issues such as the nature of beauty and what is good, he observes that they know very little about such issues. These people think they possess knowledge, when in fact they do not, and that is why they lack wisdom. Their way of thinking contrasts with Socrates, who thinks he lacks knowledge about these issues; more specifically, Socrates is aware of his ignorance about the nature of beauty and what is good, while the others are unaware of their own ignorance about these same issues. Because of this, Socrates is the wisest person.   

One application of being aware of ignorance for seeking wisdom is to practice a humble attitude towards the complex issues in life, such as how to interpret the Bible, evolution, the nature of sexuality, the implications of social media for our lives, and was Donald Trump an effective president? These types of questions represent complex ideas that even some of the most specialized scholars cannot answer. A wise person demonstrates their humility towards these complex issues by asking thoughtful questions about the opposing view, knowing when to withhold judgment and opinion, and with a willingness to change their mind.

### Highlights from the reading:

“When I heard the answer, I said to myself, What can the god mean? and what is the interpretation of this riddle? for I know that I have no wisdom, small or great. What can he mean when he says that I am the wisest of men? And yet he is a god and cannot lie; that would be against his nature. After a long consideration, I at last thought of a method of trying the question. I reflected that if I could only find a man wiser than myself, then I might go to the god with a refutation in my hand. I should say to him, "Here is a man who is wiser than I am; but you said that I was the wisest." Accordingly I went to one who had the reputation of wisdom, and observed to him - his name I need not mention; he was a politician whom I selected for examination - and the result was as follows: When I began to talk with him, I could not help thinking that he was not really wise, although he was thought wise by many, and wiser still by himself; and I went and tried to explain to him that he thought himself wise, but was not really wise; and the consequence was that he hated me, and his enmity was shared by several who were present and heard me. So I left him, saying to myself, as I went away: Well, although I do not suppose that either of us knows anything really beautiful and good, I am better off than he is - for he knows nothing, and thinks that he knows. I neither know nor think that I know. In this latter particular, then, I seem to have slightly the advantage of him. Then I went to another, who had still higher philosophical pretensions, and my conclusion was exactly the same. I made another enemy of him, and of many others besides him.”

“After this I went to one man after another, being not unconscious of the enmity which I provoked, and I lamented and feared this: but necessity was laid upon me - the word of God, I thought, ought to be considered first. And I said to myself, Go I must to all who appear to know, and find out the meaning of the oracle. And I swear to you, Athenians, by the dog I swear! - for I must tell you the truth - the result of my mission was just this: I found that the men most in repute were all but the most foolish; and that some inferior men were really wiser and better. I will tell you the tale of my wanderings and of the "Herculean" labors, as I may call them, which I endured only to find at last the oracle irrefutable. When I left the politicians, I went to the poets; tragic, dithyrambic, and all sorts. And there, I said to myself, you will be detected; now you will find out that you are more ignorant than they are. Accordingly, I took them some of the most elaborate passages in their own writings, and asked what was the meaning of them - thinking that they would teach me something. Will you believe me? I am almost ashamed to speak of this, but still I must say that there is hardly a person present who would not have talked better about their poetry than they did themselves. That showed me in an instant that not by wisdom do poets write poetry, but by a sort of genius and inspiration; they are like diviners or soothsayers who also say many fine things, but do not understand the meaning of them. And the poets appeared to me to be much in the same case; and I further observed that upon the strength of their poetry they believed themselves to be the wisest of men in other things in which they were not wise. So I departed, conceiving myself to be superior to them for the same reason that I was superior to the politicians.”

“At last I went to the artisans, for I was conscious that I knew nothing at all, as I may say, and I was sure that they knew many fine things; and in this I was not mistaken, for they did know many things of which I was ignorant, and in this they certainly were wiser than I was. But I observed that even the good artisans fell into the same error as the poets; because they were good workmen they thought that they also knew all sorts of high matters, and this defect in them overshadowed their wisdom - therefore I asked myself on behalf of the oracle, whether I would like to be as I was, neither having their knowledge nor their ignorance, or like them in both; and I made answer to myself and the oracle that I was better off as I was.”

The aim in the following learning activities is to practice humility about what we know and don’t know. One way to practice humility is to ask questions and limit how often we share our opinions.
