_____________

In the previous topic, we discussed the importance of humility when seeking knowledge. Topic 4 explores the relationship between wisdom and bias and this relationship is valuable for seeking humility. Recall that a wise person seeking humility recognizes their own ignorance regarding the complex issues in life. Identifying personal ignorance also requires acknowledging one's biases. When one recognizes the deep influence of human biases on knowledge acquisition, it becomes easier to recognize one’s ignorance.

There are many types of biases, both social and cognitive. **Social bias** is a kind of negative attitude and opinion toward other members in society, usually without good reason. Examples of social bias include prejudice toward other members of society based on their race, gender, age, and so forth. A **cognitive bias** refers more generally to human intelligence, and, in some cases, to human reasoning. Specifically, cognitive bias occurs when personal interest conflicts with the acquisition of knowledge; that is, humans tend to make errors of judgment due to their bias towards self-interest. One form of cognitive bias is called **confirmation bias**. Confirmation bias is when people attempt to acquire knowledge by consulting evidence that only supports their own agenda. An example of this would be a person who believes that God exists and supports their position by viewing sources that affirm the existence of God and ignoring or misinterpreting sources that deny this belief. That person seeks information that reinforces their current opinions and generally avoids information that undermines their current opinions.

A more precise way to think about confirmation bias is called "myside" bias. While myside bias includes the error of favoring evidence that supports one’s previously held opinions, myside bias locates that error within the context of group membership. Those previously held opinions often reflect convictions to agree with one’s social group and discontentment towards agreeing with opposing social groups. For example, Stanovich describes a person who commits what is perceived as a virtuous act. If that person is a member of your social group, you will be more inclined to affirm the act as virtuous. If that person is not a member of your social group, you will be less inclined to affirm the act as virtuous. This error of reasoning comes from affirming the virtue of the act only by association with a particular social group. Stanovich contends that myside bias affects everyone, especially intellectual elites, and those who believe they are immune to such biases are more susceptible to them.

### Highlights from the reading:

“...myside bias: people evaluate evidence, generate evidence, and test hypotheses in a manner biased toward their own prior beliefs, opinions, and attitudes.”

“Research has shown that myside bias is displayed in a variety of experimental situations: people evaluate the same virtuous act more favourably if committed by a member of their own group and evaluate a negative act less unfavourably if committed by a member of their own group; they evaluate an identical experiment more favourably if the results support their prior beliefs than if the results contradict their prior beliefs; and when searching for information, people select information sources that are likely to support their own position. Even the interpretation of a purely numerical display of outcome data is tipped in the direction of the subject’s prior belief. Likewise, judgments of logical validity are skewed by people’s prior beliefs. Valid syllogisms with the conclusion “therefore, marijuana should be legal” are easier for liberals to judge correctly and harder for conservatives; whereas valid syllogisms with the conclusion “therefore, no one has the right to end the life of a fetus” are harder for liberals to judge correctly and easier for conservatives”

“myside bias is one of the most ubiquitous of biases because it is exhibited by the vast majority of subjects studied. Myside bias is also not limited to individuals with certain cognitive or demographic characteristics. It is one of the most universal of cognitive biases.”

“In short, the convictions that determine your side when you think in a mysided fashion, often don’t come from rational thought.”

“However, one particular bias—myside bias—sets a trap for the cognitively sophisticated. Regarding most biases, they are used to thinking—rightly—that they are less biased. However, myside thinking about your political beliefs represents an outlier bias where this is not true.”

“This may lead to a particularly intense bias blind spot among certain cognitive elites. If you are a person of high intelligence, if you are highly educated, and if you are strongly committed to an ideological viewpoint, you will be highly likely to think you have thought your way to your viewpoint.”

“University faculty in the social sciences fit this bill perfectly. And the opening for a massive bias blind spot occurs when these same faculty think that they can objectively study, within the confines of an ideological monoculture, the characteristics of their ideological opponents.”

“Anything that makes us more skeptical about our beliefs will tend to decrease the myside bias that we display (by preventing beliefs from turning into convictions).”

“In short, just as we are gorging on fat-laden food that is not good for us because our bodies were built by genes with a selfish replicator survival logic, so we are gorging on memes that fit our resident beliefs because cultural replicators have a similar survival logic. And just as our overconsumption of fat-laden fast foods has led to an obesity epidemic, so our overconsumption of congenial memes has made us memetically obese as well.”

“When I talk to lay audiences about different types of cognitive processes, I use the example of broccoli and ice cream. Some cognitive processes are demanding but necessary. They are the broccoli. Other thinking tendencies come naturally to us and they are not cognitively demanding processes. They are the ice cream. In lectures, I point out that broccoli needs a cheerleader, but ice cream does not. This is why education rightly emphasizes the broccoli side of thinking—why it stresses the psychologically demanding types of thinking that people need encouragement to practice.”

When you first wake up, remember that you are biased. As you discuss controversies with fellow students, colleagues, family, and friends, your biases are hard at work, practically bullying you into thinking a certain way. The moment you deny this reality, you succumb to yet another bias. The aim in the following learning activity is to become more aware of one’s cognitive biases and how that awareness can promote an attitude of humility.
