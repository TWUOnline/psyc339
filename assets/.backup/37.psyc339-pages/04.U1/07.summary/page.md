## Unit 1 summary

In Unit 1, we introduced some concepts and applications of wisdom. One insight about wisdom is that wisdom is a guide to living life well, and the topics covered in Unit 1 expounded that idea of how to live life well.

Living life well often requires setting reasonable goals and practicing good habits to achieve these goals. Setting reasonable goals and practicing good habits includes obtaining knowledge by way of healthy doubt, both knowledge of the day-to-day and knowledge of the highest order, such as knowledge about God, science, and morality. Knowledge can be difficult to obtain, however. And, thus, a wise person recognizes their ignorance of the complex issues in life. Furthermore, admitting one’s ignorance is necessary for acknowledging human biases. Human minds are wired to think certain ways and those biases may hinder the quest for acquiring knowledge and living life well.

Humans are social creatures and learning to live life well often occurs within social contexts. One must learn to live well with other people. A wise person gains knowledge from their opponents by acting with charity.  A charitable person does not interrupt, insult, or demean their opponent or their argument. A charitable person attempts to restructure the opponent’s argument in its strongest form and then respectfully engage that argument with objections.

The final topic in Unit 1 introduced rhetoric, the art of persuasion. A wise person knows how to get along in life and that “getting along” requires some degree of tact. When one applies for a job, volunteers for a charitable organization, deals with a frustrating professor or employer, chooses to get married, and negotiates a mortgage, one must be able to persuade others (and oneself) to some extent. Learning to practice these concepts of wisdom can help with learning how to live life well.
