A major part of our learning in Topics 1-3 focused on the premises and conclusions of an argument. Additionally, we learned about the keywords for identifying those parts, and how to label the premises and conclusion with letters in parentheses. As illustrated in the previous topics, notice that writing an argument in vertical form, with premises on top and the conclusion on the bottom, is the most effective way to illustrate the final argument. For example,   

1.       All humans are mortal. (P)
2.       Lucy is a human. (P)
3.       Therefore, Lucy is mortal. (C)


That vertical format is valuable for the reader to know exactly what the argument is about. Unfortunately, arguments in ordinary discourse are not written in that vertical fashion - as illustrated in Topic 3, where arguments were written horizontally - and therefore one must restructure the horizontal argument format to a vertical argument format. In Topic 4, we practice all of the methods above with the aim of restructuring the argument vertically.

### Learning Activity 2.4: Label and structure the argument
:fa-pencil: This activity has two steps. The first step is to click/drag the appropriate letter into the box to label the premises and conclusion. In the second step, click/drag the appropriate premise and conclusion to complete the vertical argument.

_Checklist:_

- Focus on statements and ignore non-statements
- Locate the premises and conclusion using keywords
- Label the premises and conclusion using letters in parentheses
- Restructure the argument vertically, with premises on top and the conclusion on the bottom


For example:
!!! “Lucy is a teacher. All teachers drink coffee. Therefore, Lucy drinks coffee.”

Step 1: Label the argument

!!! (P) Lucy is a teacher. (P) All teachers drink coffee. (C) Therefore, Lucy drinks coffee.


Step 2: Restructure the argument vertically

1. Lucy is a teacher. (P)
2. All teachers drink coffee. (P)
3. Therefore, Lucy drinks coffee. (C)
