The purpose of Topic 1 was to introduce the elements of an argument, such as statements, non-statements, and sentences. We learned about the premises, conclusion, and inferences (note, again, that we do not cover inferences in this class). Topic 2 discusses the use of keywords to identify the premises and conclusion of an argument.

Some arguments are difficult to locate because the premises and conclusion remain unclear. In those difficult cases, one strategy for identifying the argument is locating **keywords** indicating the premises and conclusion. Keywords that indicate premises include: **“All, every, most, some, none, for, because, If…then.”** Keywords that indicate the conclusion are: **“therefore, so, thus, hence, consequently, it follows that…”** Consider the following example:

  1. **All** humans are mortal. (Premise)
  2.  Lucy is a human. (Premise)
  3.  **Therefore**, Lucy is mortal. (Conclusion)

In that example, the first premise follows the term “All,” and the conclusion follows the term “Therefore.” The second premise does not have a keyword, but, in this case, the reader knows that statement is not the conclusion – because the conclusion was identified already with the keyword “therefore” – and so the second statement must be a premise (this isn’t always the case, but we needn’t be concerned about that here). The argument is easy to identify because both the premise and conclusion have keywords.
