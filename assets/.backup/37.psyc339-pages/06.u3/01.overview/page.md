## Overview
The third unit examines the idea of faith. The aim in this unit is to (i) consider some definitions of faith; and (ii), inquire if, and in what way, faith coincides with wisdom and reason. One idea associated with the term faith is belief. To say that one has “faith in God” may imply that one believes that God exists. That view of faith centers on intellectual assent by affirming a statement about God. However, the term faith can also refer to a personal trust in something or someone. Thus, the phrase “faith in God” may also  refer to trusting God for some state of affairs. Those two initial definitions of faith are different and yet may apply in the same instance. One may possess “faith in God” and in doing so believe both that God exists and trust God to bring about some state of affairs. Or one may believe that God exists, but maintain that God cannot be trusted to bring about some state of affairs. The term faith can also mean hope. According to that view, to have “faith in God” means to desperately hope that God exists and will bring about some good state of affairs, even if one lacks belief that God exists. That third definition of faith as hope is often distinguished from faith as belief. Finally, the term faith may refer to other ideas besides belief and hope. To live a life of faith may require that a person act a certain kind of way; if that person fails to live a life of faith, then they in fact lack faith (even if they “believe” accordingly). This final view of defining faith focuses less on intellectual assent - the types of beliefs and hopes one affirms - and more on behavior.
