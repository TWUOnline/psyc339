In this topic, we explore a first way to think about faith. For Pojman, religious faith - particularly in the midst of doubt - entails a hope that the claims of that faith are true (e.g.. in the case of Christianity, that creation is restored, forgiveness, and resurrection). Pojman’s view of faith differs from some traditional definitions of faith that focus on affirming correct beliefs. According to Pojman, faith requires hope and not belief. One reason Pojman affirms that position is because the acquisition of belief is largely beyond one’s control and thus one cannot be held responsible for those beliefs. For example, the belief that “I see a tree” is something the world generates in the mind through perception. One cannot help but believe that they see a tree in the appropriate circumstances. Belief in God may resemble the example of perceiving the tree in that one cannot help but believe in God or disbelieve in God, depending on the appropriate circumstances. By contrast, Pojman argues that hope is within one’s control and thus one can be held responsible for their hopes. So, for Pojman, a person who desperately hopes in the truth of Christianity, who takes appropriate action in light of that hope, even though they do not believe the truth of Christianity, may find themselves in God’s good company.

### Highlights from the reading:

“Traditionally, orthodox Christianity has claimed (1) that faith in God and Christ entails belief that God exists and that Christ is God incarnate and (2) that without faith we are damned to eternal hell. Thus, doubt is an unacceptable propositional attitude.”

“Beliefs are not chosen but occur involuntarily as responses to states of affairs in the world.”

“When a person acquires a belief, the world forces itself upon him.”

“There is something incoherent in stating that one can obtain or sustain a belief in full consciousness simply by a bais act of the will - that is, purposefully disregarding the evidence…”

Suppose I say that I believe I have $1000,000 in my checking account, and suppose that when you point out to me that there is no reason to believe this, I respond, “I know that there is not the slightest reason to suppose that there is $1000,000 in my checking account, but I believe it anyway, simply because I want to.”

“If we have a moral duty not to volit [that is, to hold beliefs only because of our will to do so] but to seek the truth impartially and passionately, then we ought not to obtain religious belief by willing to have them; instead we should follow the best evidence we can get.”


“The point may be put more simply. Suppose you are fleeing a murderous gang of desperados who are betn on your annihilation. You come to the edge of a cliff that overlooks a yawning gorge. You find a rope spanning the gorge - tied to a tree on the cliff on the opposite side - and a man who announces that he is a tight-rope walker and can carry you over the gorge on the rope. He doesn’t look as if he can do it, so you wonder whether he is insane or simply overconfident. He takes a few steps on the rope to assure you that he can balance himself. You agree that it’s possible that he can navigate the rope across the gorge, but you have grave doubts about whether he can carry you. But your options are limited. Soon your pursuers will be upon you. You must decide. Whereas you still don’t believe that the ‘tight-rope walker’ can save you, you decide to trust him. You place your faith in his ability, climb on his back, close your eyes, and do your best to relax and obey his commands in adjusting your body as he steps onto the rope. You have a profound, even desperate, hope that he will be successful. This is how I see religious hope functioning in the midst of doubt.”
