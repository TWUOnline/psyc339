## Tips for writing an essay:

1. **Time**. Give yourself as much time as possible to write the essay.
2. **Outline**. Construct a blueprint of the the essay with bullet points, main points and sub-points. What is the essay about? What topic are you reflecting on? What question are you attempting to answer? Try to get a general idea of what you’re writing about and how you’re going to outline that idea. One way to test the general flow of your essay is to imagine yourself presenting the essay in powerpoint with a 10 min time limit. How would you condense your work? What are the major sections and subsections that would be covered?
3. **First draft**. Write a first draft of the essay. Draft the introduction by describing succinctly the details of the essay. For example, “In this essay, I will argue that…xyz”. Or, “In this essay, I will reflect on such and such.” This is a reflection essay and so using first-personal pronouns is appropriate (first-person is also appropriate in other types of essays, depending on the topic, field, etc.). Also note that sometimes you learn about your essay while writing. As you write, new ideas may come to mind that better align with your objective. So writing a first draft may not reflect the final product. Rather, the first draft functions as the brainstorming process necessary for writing the final product.
4. **Second draft**. Rewrite the essay from beginning to end.
5. **Third draft**. If you have time.
6. **Edit**. Read the essay 20 more times. Spend more time editing the essay than drafting the essay. Read over and over until you can read the entire essay without finding any errors (there are always errors, to be sure, but your task is to reduce those errors as much as possible). Try to locate unnecessary words and remove them. Avoid using confusing terms. Imagine you’re writing for your own mother with the aim that your mother understands the content without additional help. Double check that the flow of the essay is clear and rearrange sections/paragraphs if required.
7. **Polish**. Double-check sources and citations, titles, page numbers, margins, class section, name, date, spacing, etc.
8. **Final Reading**. Read the entire document one last time before submitting.
