## Unit 3 summary

Unit 3 focused on faith. The term “faith” is ambiguous and it’s important to explore a range of definitions and reflect how those definitions apply to life. Students explored two ways to think about faith. Pojman’s article defines faith as hope and not belief. Some people find believing in God difficult, either because of the evidence against God’s existence or because they do not trust God, or both. The second article focused on defining faith as action and not only belief and trust. A person of faith acts a certain way, and this definition of faith is related to Christian salvation. A person inherits the afterlife by how they live and not only what they believe.
