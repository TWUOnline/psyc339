The second topic focuses on another definition of faith. While Boyd and Thorsen’s chapter deals largely with Christian ethics, a valuable topic in its own right, especially noting the relationship between ethics and wisdom, the chapter includes a valuable discussion about the nature of faith. In some Christian traditions, faith coincides with salvation. That is, faith in God is motivated in part to receive forgiveness and secure the afterlife. In some cases, that commitment to faith for salvation aligns with understanding faith as belief and trust - the first two definitions of faith described above. However, Boyd and Thorsen briefly summarize a different view of faith (and, indeed, salvation) such that faith requires living a certain kind of life - a life devoted to Christian virtue. Christian virtue focuses on the ethics of love towards God, other individuals (particularly the neediest) and to society as a whole. Thus, Boyd and Thorsen’s chapter provides valuable insight into Christian wisdom. A Christian should focus not only on the principles of wisdom described in Unit 1, but should reflect on how those principles of wisdom align with Christian faith and moral responsibility towards God, individuals, and society.

### Highlights from the reading:
“...the sermon [on the mount] culminates in what is known as the golden rule: “In everything do to others as you would have them do to you.” (41)

“From this brief survey of how Christians have interpreted the Sermon on the Mount, we can see that there is no unanimity with regard to how to understand Jesus’s teachings in general and his ethics in particular. This does mean that we are without guidance with regard to learning about Jesus’s beliefs, values, and practices.” (44-5)

“But Christians should be humble when making their claims about what Jesus and the Christian Scriptures state precisely about any particular ethical issue.”

“The so-called new perspective on Paul emphasizes a greater continuity between Paul’s view of grace and faith, including God’s role in providing for people’s salvation, and the conditionality of their choosing to assent, repent, and act faithfully” (46).

“Although Christians have had divergent opinions of the degree to which obedience to God’s laws relates to the gospel message of salvation, they agree that people are responsible for their moral choices.” (47)

“The greatest ethical command that Jesus gave had to do with love, and this principle is echoed throughout the Christian Scriptures.” (48)
