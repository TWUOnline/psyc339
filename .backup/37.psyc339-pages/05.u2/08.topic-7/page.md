In the previous topics, we learned about identifying arguments. In this final topic, we apply those tools to identifying more difficult arguments. The examples below are more challenging because the arguments are not only greater length, but the arguments can be difficult to identify. One must carefully sift through the statements to decipher (i) does an argument exist, and (ii) if yes, then what is the conclusion(s) and the premises supporting that conclusion(s)? One must employ all the methods to achieve those tasks: such as ignoring non-statements, search for keywords that indicate premises and conclusions (highlight them, if that helps), label the premises and conclusions in parentheses, interpret what the author intended to say, and restructure the argument vertically in its strongest form. Note: more complex arguments often include multiple conclusions and those conclusions may operate as premises of the same argument. Note: when encountering a lengthy passage, read the entire passage through multiple times before attempting to identify the parts of the argument. The reason for that is to gain a broader understanding of what the author intended to say.  

_Checklist:_
- Focus on statements and ignore non-statements
- Locate the premises and conclusion using keywords
- Label the premises and conclusion using letters and numerals in parentheses
- Restructure the argument vertically, with premises on top and the conclusion beneath

Example 3 is more challenging. In these types of cases, read through the entire passage several times to decipher the argument exactly. Take time to draft multiple arguments vertically and observe which version best represents what the author intended to say. In fact, the argument above can be simplified to the final conditional sentence alone:
- If subjectivism is contradictory, then subjectivism if false.
- Subjectivism is contradictory.
- Therefore, subjectivism is false.

 That argument essentially sums up what the author intended to say. Of course, one would have to evaluate that argument but exploring the truth of each premise - we neednâ€™t do that here - and in doing so, would explicate the reasons described above in defense of those premises.
