An argument is a set of statements organized in a specific way, for example:

1. All humans are mortal. (Premise)

2. Lucy is human. (Premise)

3. Therefore, Lucy is mortal. (Conclusion)


The statements above are organized as an argument because one of the statements, the conclusion, is supported by the other set of statements, the premises. By reading these premises and the conclusion carefully, one can see that the premises support the truth of the conclusion. **For our purposes, the order of the premises does not matter**. For example, the following argument is the same as the argument above:

1. Lucy is human.

2. <u> All humans are mortal. </u>

3. Therefore, Lucy is mortal.


_The space between the premises and the conclusion is called the **inference**. The line illustrates when the premises end and where the conclusion follows. The term “inference” refers to the relationship between premises and conclusion, and that relationship changes depending on the type of argument in use. Put in a different way, the inference refers to how one moves from premise to conclusion. Sometimes that inference is one of certainty, in that the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion; other times that inference is one of probability, in that the truth of the premises raises the probable truth of the conclusion. **(You are not required to know about the different types of inferences in this class)**._

The **premises** are the “reasons” for why one should think the **conclusion** is true, and therefore the conclusion is being defended with those premises. The premises and conclusion will always be described with **statements**, and statements are claims that are **either true or false**. Non-statements, however, do not express claims that are either true or false, and thus non-statements are never premises or conclusions. Knowing the difference between statements and non-statements is important because that knowledge will help with identifying the parts of the argument. For example:


1. Apples are red.

2. Tony Stark is Iron Man.

3. Was that a magic trick?

4. Hey, partner!

The first two examples are statements because they express claims that are either true or false. The third example is a question and does not express a claim that is either true or false. Therefore, the third example is a non-statement. (Of course, if one answered the question by saying, “that is a magic trick,” then that answer to the question is a statement that is either true or false). The fourth example is an exclamatory greeting and does not express a claim that is either true or false. Therefore, the fourth example is a non-statement. Remember, then, that arguments are made up of statements and never made up of non-statements.  


Note that a **statement** is different from a **sentence**. A sentence has a subject and a predicate. The subject is what or whom the sentence is about, and the predicate is a description of the subject and contains the verb. Sometimes a whole sentence is one statement, for example:

!!! “The cat is in the hat.”


That entire sentence is a statement because the sentence is either true or false. Other times a whole sentence includes multiple statements, for example:

!!! “If the cat is in the hat, then the fish is in the bowl.”


In that example, the first part, “the cat is in the hat,” is the first statement, and the second part, “the fish is in the bowl,” is the second statement. So even though that example is one sentence, the entire sentence includes multiple statements that are either true or false.

More difficult sentences may include both statements and non-statements, for example:

!!! “Stop, the train is approaching.”


In that example, the first part, “Stop,” is a non-statement, and the second part, “the train is approaching,” is a statement. The reason is because the word “Stop” does not express a claim that is either true or false, and the phrase “the train is approaching” does express a claim that is either true or false. **When identifying the premises and conclusion of an argument, one should only focus on statements and always ignore non-statements.**
