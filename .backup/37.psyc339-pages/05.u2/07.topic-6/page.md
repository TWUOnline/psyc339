In topics 1-5, we learned about the parts of the argument, and, in doing so, learned some strategies for identifying arguments. However, as arguments become more complicated, one must learn new techniques.

Some arguments use sentences with the terms “If…Then.” These types of sentences are called conditional sentences (or conditionals) and often appear in arguments. For example:

!!! “**IF** Willy is a whale, **THEN** Willy is a mammal.”

As discussed briefly in an earlier section, note that some sentences may include multiple statements and thus include multiple premises. However, note that conditional sentences, while they may include multiple statements, **always constitute one premise**. That is, both “If…Then” statements in a conditional sentence are not different premises of the argument but are parts of the same premise.

For example:
1.      **If Willy is a whale, then Willy is a mammal.** (P)
2.       Willy is a whale. (P2)
3.       Therefore, Willy is a mammal. (C1)


**The first premise includes both “If…Then” statements**, and both statements in the conditional can be defined. The first statement following the term “If” is called the **antecedent**. That means the thing that comes before. The second statement following the term “Then” is called the **consequent**. That means the thing that comes after, or the thing that follows from the antecedent, for example:

!!! “If Willy is a whale (antecedent), then Willy is a mammal (consequent).”

Conditional sentences are tricky business. While we needn’t be concerned with those difficulties in this Unit, three factors deserve attention for the purpose of identifying arguments: (i) notice that the terms “if'' and “then” are keywords that may indicate a conditional premise; (ii), notice the conclusion in the argument above, “Willy is a mammal,” is smuggled into the second part (the consequent) of the first premise. When identifying a conditional sentence, the consequent of that conditional may be a clue for locating the conclusion (not always, but sometimes); and (iii), conditional sentences can be expressed in English in different ways. So one must learn to identify some of these expressions and practice how to convert them into standard “If…then” form.


**a. Sentences with the term “if” in the middle**

!!! “Willy is a mammal **IF** Willy is a whale.”

**The term “if” introduces the antecedent, and the antecedent always comes first in the conditional sentence**. So, rewrite the sentence above to standard conditional form by moving the term “if” and the antecedent, “Willy is a whale,” to the beginning of the sentence, and add the term “then” to the beginning of the consequent, “Willy is a mammal”:

!!! “**If** Willy is a whale, **then** Willy is a mammal.”

Now the argument can be structured vertically, for example:
1.       If Willy is a whale, then Willy is a mammal. (P)
2.       Willy is a whale. (P)
3.       Therefore, Willy is a mammal. (C)

**b. Sentences with the phrase “only if” at the beginning**
!!! “**Only if** Willy is a mammal, is Willy a whale.”

**The term “only if” introduces the consequent, and the consequent is always located at the end of the conditional sentence**. So, change the term “only if” to “then” and move its consequent, “Willy is a mammal,” to the end. Then move the last statement, “Willy is a whale,” to the beginning with the term “If” added in front because that statement is the antecedent.

!!! “If Willy is a whale, then Willy is a mammal.”

**c.  Sentences with the phrase “only if” in the middle:**
!!! “Willy is a whale only if Willy is a mammal.”

Note, again, that the phrase “**only if**” introduces the consequent. Rewrite the sentence by converting “only if” to “then,” and add the term “If” to the beginning.

!!! “If Willy is a whale, then Willy is a mammal.”

**d. Sentences with the term “unless” at the beginning**
!!! “**Unless** you eat vegetables, there’s no dessert.”

**The term “unless” introduces the antecedent with a negation** (i.e. “not”) and is translated to “**if not.**” So, rewrite by replacing “unless” with “if not” and add the term “then” to the beginning of the consequent.

“**If not** you eat vegetables, **then** there’s no dessert.”

Obviously, that sentence above, although logically correct, must be rewritten to make sense:
!!! “**If** you do **not** eat vegetables, then there’s no dessert.”

**e. Sentences with the term “unless” in the middle**
!!! “There’s no dessert UNLESS you eat vegetables.”

Rewrite by changing “unless” to “if not,” move “if not” and its statement, “you eat vegetables,” to the beginning to make the antecedent; add “then” to the second statement, “there’s no dessert,” to make the consequent.

!!! “**If** you do not eat vegetables, **then** there’s no dessert.”

**f. Sentences with the phrase “provided that”**
!!! “You may eat dessert **provided that** you eat vegetables.”

**The phrase “provided that” introduces the antecedent**. Rewrite by changing “provided that” to “if” and move “if” and its statement, “you eat vegetables,” to the beginning to make the antecedent; add the term “then” to the beginning of the other statement, “You may eat dessert,” to make the consequent, for example:

!!! “**If** you eat vegetables, **then** you may eat dessert.”

Now you know how to identify different ways of expressing “If…then,” and how to rewrite those expressions to simplify ordering the argument vertically.

**Conditional Sentences Cheat Sheet:**
1. Antecedent: the first statement in a conditional sentence introduced with the term “If”
2. Consequent: the second statement in a conditional sentence introduced with the term “then”
3. “If” = always introduces the antecedent, regardless of location
4. “Only if” = always introduces the consequent, regardless of location
5. “Unless” = always introduces the antecedent with a negation, regardless of location, translated as “if not”
6. “Provided that” = always introduces the antecedent regardless of location

### Learning Activity 2.6: Arguments with conditionals
:fa-pencil: This activity has two steps. The first step is to click/drag the appropriate letter into the box to label the premises and conclusion. In the second step, click/drag the appropriate premise and conclusion to complete the vertical argument.

_Checklist:_
- Focus on statements and ignore non-statements.
- Locate the premises and conclusion using keywords. **NOTE: the terms “if” and “then” may be keywords for indicating a conditional sentence and a premise of an argument. NOTE: expressions such as “only if” and “unless” (in green) indicate conditionals. Note how those expressions (in green) will change to standard “If/Then” conditionals when ordering the argument vertically.**
- Label the premises and conclusion using letters in parentheses.
- Restructure the argument vertically, with premises on top and the conclusion beneath.
- **Notice the changes to the wording in some of the premises and conclusions.**


Example 1:
!!! “If that thing walks like a duck, then that thing is a duck. That thing walks like a duck. Therefore, that thing is a duck.

**Step 1:** Label the argument

!!! (P) If that thing walks like a duck, then that thing is a duck. (P) That thing walks like a duck. (C) Therefore, that thing is a duck.

**Step 2:** Restructure the argument vertically
1. If that animal walks like a duck, then that animal is a duck.
2. That animal walks like a duck.
3. Therefore, that animal is a duck.


Example 2:
!!! “I’ll marry you only if you watch Downton Abbey. What!? You refuse to watch Downton Abbey. You’re kidding me! Well, I refuse to marry you.”

**Step 1:** Label the argument (notice the change from "only if" to "if then")

!!! (P) If I marry you, then you must watch Downton Abbey. (P) You refuse to watch Downton Abbey. (C) I will not marry you.

**Step 2:** Restructure the argument vertically
1.  	If I marry you, then you must watch Downton Abbey
2.  	You refuse to watch Downton Abbey
3.  	Thus, I will not marry you.
