## Unit 2 Summary

Unit 2 focused on how to identify arguments. Learning to identify arguments is valuable because sometimes we fail to both identify and understand an opponent’s argument before raising objections. Arguments are statements structured in a specific way, such that one the of the statements, the conclusion, is supported by the other statements, the premises. Statements are claims that are either true or false and can be expressed using sentences, subordinate clauses, and conditionals (to name a few), but never exclamatory sentences and questions. Students should know how to locate keywords for identifying premises and conclusion, know how to label both with letters in parentheses, and then order the premises and conclusion vertically. Students should have some knowledge about how to interpret and identify arguments in more complicated passages by using the “why/because” strategy.
