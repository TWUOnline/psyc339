_Pre-reading: Jay Heinrichs, “Set Your Goals,” chapter 2 in Thank you for Arguing: What Aristotle, Lincoln, and Homer Simpson can teach us about the Art of Persuasion.”_
_____________


Topic 6 is about wisdom and rhetoric. Rhetoric refers to **the art of persuasion** or influence. Previously we discussed how wisdom requires an awareness and application of our actions, knowledge, humility, biases, and charity. The art of persuasion employs all of these skills. Along with those skills of wisdom, rhetoric also requires some tools of argumentation. A clarification regarding rhetoric is that the terms "argument", "argue", and "argumentation" can mean different things in different contexts. Students will learn the technical definitions of "argument" and "argumentation" in Unit 2, which may differ from how those terms are used in this topic of rhetoric. The student will also have the opportunity to develop some of the tools of technical argumentation in Unit 2, which will hone their rhetorical skills.

Arguments with other people, such as family, friends, or colleagues, are part of everyday life. A wise person knows how to argue without fighting. According to Heinrichs, a necessary skill for arguing productively is knowing the appropriate goal you wish to bring about. Are you trying to influence someone's decision? Is that feasible? Are you hoping to feel like a winner? Is that an appropriate goal? It may be your goal to change the mood of your opponent, or simply to inform your opponent of a different point of view. Would you like to end the argument quickly? After the argument, would you like to maintain the relationship with the person? Should you pursue either of these goals? How will you go about accomplishing your goal? In what way are you prepared to compromise? Are you prepared to experience defeat from your opponent's point of view in order to achieve your goal? What is the purpose of the argument and how should it be achieved?

Exercising the previous skills of wisdom when arguing with other people is helpful for practicing rhetoric. Wise actions, for example, require setting reasonable goals and avoiding the pitfalls that may undermine these goals. Similarly, when applying rhetoric in an argument with someone else, focus on the goal you wish to bring about and be willing to concede as much as possible to get there. Furthermore, remember that wisdom requires knowledge and humility. When those skills are applied to rhetoric, demonstrate the ability to challenge your own views to show your intention to understand the opponent's position. Knowledge of one's own bias is also essential to rhetoric. Ensure that the opponent understands that you are aware of your own biases and that you will listen to and learn from them. And in everything, act with charity. When arguing with others, assist them with their arguments, and, if possible, suggest ways in which their arguments can be strengthened. Demonstrate your comfort with the exchange by temporarily embracing their viewpoint. Charity of this kind encourages your opponent to act in a similar  manner, and, in doing so, may reduce the defensiveness of each person. Depending on your rhetorical goal when arguing with another person, the tactics above may be useful.

### Highlights from the reading:

“This chapter will help you distinguish between an argument and a fight, and to choose what you want to get out of an argument.” (p, 16)
“You succeed in an argument when you persuade your audience.” (p. 16)

“...argument by the stick - fighting - is no argument. It never persuades, it only inspires revenge or retreat.” (p.17)

“In a fight, one person takes out his aggression on another. Donald Trump was fighting when he said of Rosie O’Donnell, “I mean, I'd look at her in that fat, ugly face of hers, I’d say ‘Rosie, you’re fired.’ On the other hand, when Geroge Foreman tries to sell you a grill, he makes an argument: persuasion that tries to change your mood, your mind, or your willingness to do something.” (p.17)

“The basic difference between an argument and a fight: an argument, done skillfully, gets people to want what you want. You fight to win; you argue to achieve agreement.” (p. 17)

“Changing the mood is the easiest goal, and usually the one you work on first [#1 goal].” (p. 21)
“ …making them decide what you want.” [#2 goal] (p. 21)

“Goal number three - in which you get an audience to do something or stop doing it - is the most difficult.” [#3 goal] (p.22).

The aim in the following  learning activity is to practice a skill of rhetoric: set a goal of changing the mood of the argument and try to outline the way of achieving that goal. One way to change the mood of the argument is by (implicitly) affirming your opponent’s view. Say something like this: “Fair enough. I need to think about this. Can you explain that in more detail?” OR “That’s good advice. Can you tell me a bit more?” Be careful not to patronize, but sincerely affirm your opponent’s view to change the mood of the debate, from each person being defensive to each person being receptive.
