_Pre-reading: (Preface to Principles of Philosophy; Principles 1, 2, 3, 75)_
_____________

In the previous topic, we established that knowledge is not sufficient for wisdom because wisdom requires action. That is, knowledge must be applied correctly in order to live life well. While Descartes endorses that view of the limitations of knowledge and the importance of application, he maintains that one should pursue knowledge in the highest domains, such as knowledge of God, science, and morality, because that knowledge benefits the one pursuing wisdom and a fulfilling life.

There are two ideas associated with wisdom and knowledge to discuss. The first idea is that **acquiring knowledge requires the practice of doubting**. Do not believe everything you read and hear. The second idea is that a **wise person obtains knowledge of the most valuable things in life, such as knowledge about God, science, and morality**. According to Descartes, pursuing knowledge of these higher domains is not only a good in itself, but that higher knowledge can enable one to live a better life.

Having doubt about something does not entail rejecting its truth. For our purposes, doubting something means applying careful consideration, such as asking yourself: Why should I think this is true? What is the best way to verify the claim? Who can give me an informed opinion? Are there any concerns about this content? Which aspects of the content are strong and which are weak? Healthy doubt is valuable for acquiring knowledge and living life well. For example, whenever we detect incoming scams, such as phone and computer scams, we employ doubt.  In this regard, one intends to uncover the nature of the scam and warn others of its harmful potential. The hesitation (or doubt) to believe and act according to the computer scam is similar to the hesitation one should apply when listening to the news, a podcast, a sermon, or reading an opinion on Facebook or Twitter. However, particularly in ordinary affairs, Decartes also warns that extreme doubt may be harmful. Neither the need for basic necessities nor the importance of friendship should be questioned. When individuals are faced with situations such as these, it is often necessary that they act even if they lack all the information about the situation. Descartes argues that remaining paralyzed by doubt is an inadvisable course.

To pursue a higher knowledge about God, science, and morality, Descartes imagines the structure of a tree, whose roots are metaphysics, the trunk is physics, and the branches represent the remainder of scientific inquiry, including morality (note that 'science' in this context encompasses more domains than a contemporary definition of science). Descartes believed that in order to understand the human condition, one must have an understanding of metaphysics and science. Descartes’ point about seeking this type of valuable knowledge about God, science, and morality is relevant because of the human obsession with entertainment. We often seek entertainment and pleasure rather than searching for the truth about the most important ideas in life. That obsession with entertainment and the neglect of seeking valuable knowledge undermines one’s potential to gain wisdom and seek a fulfilling life.

### Highlights from the reading (Preface):

1.  For example, the word ‘philosophy' means the study of wisdom, and by ‘wisdom’ it means not only prudence in our everyday affairs but also a perfect knowledge of all things that mankind is capable of knowing…” (179)
2.  “...we should not doubt the probable truths which concern the conduct of life…”(182).
3.  “Thus, the whole of philosophy is like a tree. The roots are metaphysics, the trunk is physics, and the branches emerging from the trunk are all the other sciences…” (186)
4.  “...For although the truth often does not touch our imagination as much as falsehood and pretense, because it seems less striking and more plain, nevertheless the satisfaction it produces is always more durable and more solid.” (188)
5.  “The second benefit [of studying Descartes’ principles of philosophy] is that the study of these principles will accustom people little by little to form better judgments about all the things they come across, and hence will make them wiser.” (188)

The aim of the following learning activities is to explore and learn about these two applications of knowledge: the practice of doubt and the acquisition of valuable knowledge over entertainment.
