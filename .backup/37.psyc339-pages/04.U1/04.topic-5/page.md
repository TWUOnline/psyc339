_Pre-reading: Ralph H. Johnson, “Charity Begins at Home”_
_____________

In Topic 5, the emphasis is on wisdom and charity. The term “charity” in this case refers to **a principle of treating a person's argument and/or opinion in its strongest form**. In the previous two topics, we discussed humility and bias, both of which are relevant to practicing charity. For example, when employing humility, one is aware of their ignorance and the need to ask questions about the opponent’s view. That questioning can be a type of charity when done for the purpose of gaining understanding. Similarly, one is aware of myside bias, and that bias influences the interpretation and treatment of the opponent, especially if that opponent is from another social group. Recognizing the powerful influence of myside bias promotes charity by helping constrain one’s immediate rejection of the opponent’s view.

Charity involves more than humility and awareness of bias: it requires willpower. One must willfully, and temporarily, embrace the opponent’s view, assist with constructing that view in its best possible light, and then express the view better than the opponent. The act of embracing an opposing argument is challenging for many reasons, but, as stated in the previous chapter on bias, humans are not built to act with charity toward those with whom they disagree, especially when those convictions are strong. Put in a different way, humans struggle to, on the one hand, affirm a viewpoint in which they hold strong convictions, and then, on the other hand, compartmentalize that view away while attempting to charitably evaluate objections to that conviction.

In his article, “Charity Begins at Home,” Johnson outlines the general principle of charity and then discusses some of the challenges with that principle. Practicing charity involves three steps:

1. Identifying the argument: Does the argument even exist? According to Johnson, the first step is difficult in its own right because the art of constructing a well-organized argument is in decline.
2. Reconstructing the argument: This step requires that one re-build the argument to follow the rules of logical inference. Sometimes arguments include additional hidden premises, irrelevant information, and are simply weak or invalid. One must reconstruct the argument in its strongest form.
3. Presenting the main objections to the argument: Now that the argument has been identified and properly reconstructed, one should focus on the criticisms that undermine the main premises of the argument and avoid criticizing irrelevant information and implications of the argument.

According to Johnson, a major problem with the principle of charity is that it requires too much effort and time to apply, as few people can construct an argument correctly in the first place. His solution to this problem is to apply the principle only when the following conditions are met: (i) the argument is fully expressed; (ii) the argument is brought forward by a serious person; (iii), the argument is about a serious issue. One implication of those criteria for the principle is that one should apply charity only when there is reason to think that the opponent will benefit from that charity.

### Highlights from the reading:

“The Principle of Charity which governs all levels of argument analysis is that the critic should provide the best possible interpretation of the material under consideration.” (p. 5)

“The justification of the principle is…ethical. One is under the general obligation to be fair in one’s dealings with others…” (p.5)

“There is also a prudential reason for adhering to the principle… It tells you that you want to interpret the argument’s meaning in whatever way makes the most sense and force out of it, because otherwise, it can easily be reformulated…to meet your objections.” (p.5)

“The first step in argument analysis must be to decide whether or not the passage under scrutiny contains an argument…”(p.5)

“Once a passage has been identified as containing an argument we are then faced with the task of identifying and setting forth its premises and conclusions in their logical relationships.” (p.5)

“Once the argument has been identified, extracted, and reconstructed, the job of the critic can begin…one should look for the strongest possible criticisms of the argument…”(p.6)

“Effective argument analysis can be a grueling task.” (p.8)

“Many times I have found myself wrestling with diffuse and poorly expressed arguments that seem to have been sloppily put together - something dashed off in five minutes by a loose reasoner with scant knowledge of the demands of the argumentative process.” (p.8)

“In defense of this proposal [the proposal that the only arguments deserving charity are those that meet the three criteria], let me make two points. First, the individual who dashes off a poorly expressed argument is, in all probability, not going to derive any profit from the critics’ laborious undertaking. His or her commitment to the rational process is too slight and powers of reasoning too underdeveloped (else we would not be in this situation in the first place). (p. 8).

The aim in the following learning activity is to learn about practicing charity. The goal is to embrace your opponent's position, assist them in making their position as strong as possible, and only then introduce objections to their position.
