_Pre-reading: Robert Nozick, “What Is Wisdom And Why Do Philosophers Love It So?”_

_____________

This topic examines wisdom and action. According to Nozick, wisdom is practical in that wisdom is required to live life well, to cope with and respond to the many challenges of life, and, if possible, avoid some of those challenges. For living life well, wisdom requires both affirming the right beliefs and practicing the right actions. **How do we know which beliefs and actions are appropriate for living life well?** Nozick argues that a wise person holds beliefs about many aspects of life, including beliefs about life's most important values, beliefs about achieving one's goals, and following the necessary steps to achieve these goals. Likewise, the right actions for living a fulfilling life are derived from applying the aforementioned beliefs. If a person knows about the most important values and goals in life, but never applies them to their behavior, then they are not considered wise. In other words, having knowledge does not entail wisdom. Nozick is also aware that applying the appropriate beliefs and actions is not sufficient to live life well. Sometimes bad things occur for no apparent reason, which may undermine our efforts. A wise person is aware of this problem, and while pursuing their  goals, prepares for failure, learns how to avoid it, and how to respond to it if failure occurs.

### Highlights from the reading:

1. “What is wisdom? Wisdom is an understanding of what is important, where this understanding informs a (wise) person’s thought and action. Things of lesser importance are kept in proper perspective. (p. 267)
2. “Wisdom is practical; it helps. Wisdom is what you need to understand in order to live well and cope with the central problems and avoid the dangers in the predicaments human beings find themselves in.” (p. 267)
3. “Wisdom is not just one type of knowledge, but diverse. What a wise person needs to know and understand constitutes a varied list: the most important goals and values of life - the ultimate goal, if there is one; what means will reach these goals without too great a cost; what kinds of dangers threaten the achieving of these goals; how to recognize and avoid or minimize these dangers…”(p. 269)
4. “There also will be bits of negative wisdom: certain things are NOT important.” (p. 269)
“A wise person knows these diverse things and lives them. Someone who only knew them, who offered good advice to others yet who lived foolishly himself, would not be termed wise.” (p. 270)
5. “Wisdom does guarantee success in achieving life's important goals…”(p. 270)
6. “A wise person will have gone in the right direction, and if the world thwarts his journey, he will have known how to respond to that too.” (p. 270)
7. “Moreover, the process of living wisely, pursuing or opening oneself to what is important, taking account of a range of circumstances and utilizing one’s fullest capacities to steer skillfully through them, is itself a way of being deeply connected to reality. (p. 276)
“The person who lives wisely connects to reality more thoroughly than someone who moves through life spoon-fed by circumstances, even if what they try to feed is reality.” (p. 276)
8. “Wisdom is not simply knowing how to steer one’s way through life, cope with difficulties etc.. It also is knowing the deepest story, being able to see and appreciate the deepest significance of whatever occurs…(p. 276)

This topic contains a learning activity, its purpose is to examine one application of wisdom and setting a personal goal that may improve one's life. Along with setting a personal goal, one must outline the good habits necessary to achieve that goal, and devise strategies to avoid the bad habits that would undermine it. Additionally, one needs to prepare for failure in terms of developing the right habits and reaching the end goal, as well as developing a strategy for avoiding failure and addressing it, if it happens.
