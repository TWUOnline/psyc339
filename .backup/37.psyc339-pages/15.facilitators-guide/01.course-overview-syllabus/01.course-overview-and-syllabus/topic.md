# Facilitator’s Guide for Phil 100:  

## Philosophy for Life

Your task as the facilitator is to guide the students through the course content and grade their assignments according to grading rubrics. The course has been designed with detailed instructions and explanations so that the facilitator does not require specialization in philosophy. However, the facilitator should read all the material from the course pack, the instructions in Moodle for each Unit and Topic, and work through the optional material, such as the videos and simulation and logic exercises. The aim of Philosophy 100 is to better equip students to live life well. That aim is achieved in part by helping students work through the three units in the course, wisdom, reason, and faith.
