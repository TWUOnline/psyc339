**A Note about Pedagogy**:
! Please review Andrew

This course has been developed with the following pedagogy. I have used specific content like assigned readings, videos and activities, but I have been intentional to not direct students to the KEY points of that content.  I have done this specifically because I believe that in life we all are learners, but we choose – for one reason or another – what we will learn, depending upon and directed by “something”. When you engage students together where they are seeing what they “want to” or “can” see – we don’t make the choices for them but we give space and opportunity for them to engage and learn for themselves. This is what Dr. Jim Parsons calls “hard-shell outsides [you have to come to class] and soft-gooey insides [you learn what seems important to you – what sticks for one reason or another – who knows why?]." What I’ve done in this class is to NOT have the test at the end about what they have learned from the different case scenarios and readings, but to allow students to make their own test – the Case Scenario Presentation and Case Analysis Paper. That’s the sandwich – the hard shell is the (1) fact that they are required to read the resources (on one side) and (2) the course grade on the other. Their job is to (a) read the stuff, (b) learn what they will learn – for one reason or another, and (c) create a plan for implementing that learning. Then the grade is the second shell. I have no control and choose not to have any control over the “soft-gooey insides” of your learning – my job is to help create the space between the shells.
