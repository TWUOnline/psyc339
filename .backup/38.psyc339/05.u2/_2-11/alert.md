### Activity 2.11: Reflect | Looking back

In order to do the reflection for this activity. Go back and read the first chapter of In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts. Take in the Vancouver Downtown Eastside as Gabor Mate describes it.

**Reflect:**

- What comes up for you?
- In comparison to your previous attitude towards this area of town and its residents, do you feel any different now?
