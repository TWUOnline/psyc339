## Topic 3: Working with Addictions

![alttext](topic3overview.jpg "distorted light and shapes")

It may be difficult for individuals who have been affected by addiction for a considerable amount of time to determine moral leanings, personal boundaries, and what kinds of behaviors are normative, rather than simply performative and survival-based. Public policy and literature are increasingly recognizing that addiction is a maladaptive response to trauma. It is estimated that approximately two-thirds of those seeking treatment for alcohol and substance abuse issues have been affected by trauma. There is no doubt that addiction is extremely difficult to navigate and overcome, and not everyone is able to succeed for long periods of time.

Addiction is a complex issue that can be addressed with many theories and models, but EFFT remains the main approach/theory that will be discussed in this unit. During the following Learning activities you will learn about Gabor Mate’s insights into the healing process and what he calls ‘Compassionate Inquiry’ which pairs nicely with EFFT. Through Compassionate Inquiry, the client gains an understanding of how the unconscious dynamics in their lives can be released.
