### Activity 2.4: Optional Reading | A Biblical Reflection

_Read Deuteronomy 4:15-16, Isaiah 44:9, and Colossians 3:5_

The Bible talks about how an idol is anything that takes priority over our ability and willingness to worship and serve God. An idol can ‘replace’ God in our lives and our relationship with whatever we have made an idol in our lives; it becomes more important than our relationship with God. An addiction could be considered an idol as when one is in the midst of an addiction, it becomes the sole priority and as we have read, even one’s basic health may be pushed aside for the sake of engaging in the addiction.

In addition, we have read that the same neural pathways in the brain are involved in addictions and attachments. According to Genesis 2:18-23, we were created for attachment. As we have discussed previously, addiction can fill a hole inside of us when we lack the type of attachment that God intended, the secure base that allows us to fail and be okay. This is especially true for people who are trying to numb or eliminate intolerable pain.  

Consider how far our world has fallen from God's intended design for us and how far we have fallen from that design. **How does this context affect your perception of those suffering from addiction?** **Does it make a difference?**
