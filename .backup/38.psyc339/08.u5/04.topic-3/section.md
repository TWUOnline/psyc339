## Topic 3: Strategies for Dealing with Stress and Resilience

Being resilient means overcoming setbacks and challenges, such as losing a job, facing illness, experiencing a disaster, or grieving a loved one. These stressful events can lead people to unhealthy coping mechanisms, like substance abuse, eating disorders, or risky behaviors, which can make them feel stuck in their problems or victimized. While resilience doesnâ€™t eliminate difficulties, it helps people look beyond them, find joy in life, and handle stress more effectively.

This is another opportunity for us to continue learning from EFFT. The goal is for you to have a reasonably good understanding of what validation entails by now. During this session, we will develop a validation statement and add a behaviour coaching component.
