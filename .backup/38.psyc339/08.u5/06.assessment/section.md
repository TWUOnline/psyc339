## Assessment

After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to start on the class/oral presentation which is an individual assignment as well as to complete your weekly Forum question.

&nbsp;

#### Assignment 1: Case Conceptualization

**Movie to watch: Wonder (2017)**

Each student will need to complete 3 out of the 6 case conceptualizations. Each case conceptualization is due by the next week's class. For example if you choose to do this week’s case conceptualization on Trauma, you will need to complete it by our next class. Please take note of the due dates on these and plan ahead which topics you would like to do. The case conceptualization form that you will need to fill out will be provided at the end of each unit. We will go over how to complete this assignment during our first virtual class together. If you can not attend, then a recording of our class will be uploaded to Moodle for your viewing convenience. I would recommend that you choose your case conceptualizations based on which topics you are most interested in. Students will have the opportunity to use these case conceptualizations for their other assignments.

Watching these movies can be triggering and so I encourage you to choose the topics that will be less triggering for you.
