# Unit 4: Work with Mental Health Issues


Read the Unit 4 overview, unit learning outcomes, topics, activity checklist, and assessments in Moodle to familiarize yourself with student workload expectations.

&nbsp;

### Synchronous Portion

In the synchronous portion of this class, I would like you to address the topic of mental health and gender. What are some of the assumptions and stigmas around each of these mental health issues? How does this affect those seeking help as well as our potential biases and views of them? Draw upon some of the learning this past week to enhance the discussion. For example: Terry Real’s description of depression and what covert depression is, suicide clusters and the influence of gender here, committing suicide vs. dying by suicide, the population most likely to die by suicide, types of eating disorders and which genders are associated with each.

Spend some time going over the EFFT exercises for this week. This week there is more to go over as we have applied the principles of EFFT to all three of the topics. I still encourage you to go over all three as this will increase the skill level and versatility for the students to apply EFFT to each different subject. If you find yourself short on time, you can invite the students' feedback on which exercises they found more difficult or which ones they would like to go over.

Leave some time to go over any expectations for assignments at the end as their oral presentations are due the following week and some will have started to work on their papers.

### Learning Activities and Assignment
For this course, there are a number of activities that you will be required to complete.  The readings for this course are taken from a variety of resources and it is important for students to experience gaining information/insight from a variety of resources as this will hopefully help them understand and shape them for their final paper. The instructions for each activity are written in Moodle.

For this unit, note that there are three different subjects within the one heading: Suicidality, Depression and Eating Disorders. As such just be aware of the slight difference in nature of the presented material. The same format is followed as previous units with the “what it is, why it happens and how you work with it”, however the information does not go as in depth and this unit may feel slightly more disjointed than the previous units. Nothing else changes in terms of what is required of each activity and what the students need to do.

**Activity 4.1: Introduction to Depression**
The purpose of this activity is to provide students with an introduction to what Depression is and how it affects an individual.

**Activity 4.2: Read, “I don’t want to talk about it” pdf**
The purpose of this activity is to provide students with an introduction to male depression and how that can show up and manifest differently in males versus females. In males it can be a harder thing to spot and Terry Real is really good at describing what is going on using some of his own personal anecdotes.

**Activity 4.3: Case Example**
The purpose of this activity is to watch a woman describe her experience with her husband taking his life and how the root of this was unnoticed Male depression. She draws our attention to how serious this can be.

The purpose of this activity is to watch an introductory video on what an eating disorder is and how often it can manifest. Students will hear from a prominent researcher in the field.

**Activity 4.8: Optional Read | Emotional Loss of Control and Eating**
The purpose of this activity is to read an article from Janet Treasure who is a prominent researcher in the field of eating disorders in England. She will expand our learning around eating disorders to include a systemic lens and what including family could look like in the healing process. Her animal models are referenced in our EFFT text. This is an optional activity for students.

**Activity 4.9: “I don’t want to talk about it,” Chapter 4**
The purpose of this activity is to explore the connection between trauma and depression which will be integrative and continuous learning from our previous units. This chapter will continue to cover the how Male Depression develops.

**Activity 4.10: Optional Read | Psalm 88**

**Activity 4.11: Suicide and the Brain**
The purpose of this activity is to explore some of the brain science behind why suicide occurs and we look at Dr. Amen’s website and research again for this. I do not agree with his ‘therapeutic’ approach to interacting with suicide, however the brain science is good to explore.

**Activity 4.12: Risk Factors for Depression and Suicide Ideation**
The purpose of this activity is to see how mental health issues can interact together and be comorbid. This article explores this with adolescents. The second article in this activity explores the interaction of all three mental health issues we have learned about in this unit.

**Activity 4.15: Optional Read | Eating Disorders and Caregiver Involvement**
The purpose of this activity is to once again set the stage for our EFFT activity. EFFT was originally developed to aid in working with outpatient care and so it is important to read of one the research articles explaining the research. This is an optional activity for students.

**Activity 4.16: Exploring Community Resources**
