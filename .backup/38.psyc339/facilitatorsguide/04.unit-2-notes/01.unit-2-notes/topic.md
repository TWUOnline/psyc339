### Learning Activities
The activities for this course are pretty straightforward. The readings for this course are taken from a variety of resources and it is important for students to experience gaining information/insight from a variety of resources as this will hopefully help them understand and shape them for their final paper. The instructions for each activity are written in Moodle.


**Activity 2.1:  Read Chapter Introduction, Pages 1-3, & Chapters 11-16 in “In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts”**
The purpose of this activity is to introduce the subject of ‘addictions’ to the students through the lens of Gabor Mate who has done a lot of work on the streets of Vancouver and has amazing insights and wisdom to impart. The hope is that it will also challenge students' perceptions of addicts and addiction.

**Activity 2.2: Watch a Visual Portrayal**
The purpose of this activity is to watch a powerful portrayal of what the cycle of addiction can look like. It tends to hit students in a different way than just reading about it. There is a journal opportunity provided to spend some time reflecting on what was watched.

**Activity 2.3: Terms to know**
The purpose of this activity is to read through some of the important terms from the Gabor Mate’s readings that I have highlighted. This will help solidify some of the main concepts in the student’s minds as there is a lot of information to digest.

**Activity 2.4: Optional Reading | A Biblical Reflection**
The purpose of this activity is to spend some time reading a couple of biblical passages and reflecting on what God says about addiction. For those that are from a Christian background is good to provide a space to start to integrate what the world teaches about mental health and then what the bible does.This is an optional activity for students.

**Activity 2.5: 6 basic theories**
The purpose of this activity is to briefly provide definitions of 5 of the other ways that addiction has been defined as. This activity is very quick and our course focuses on the biopsychosocial theory.

**Activity 2.6: Read In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts Chapter 17 -19**
The purpose of this activity is to explore the ‘why’ behind why addiction develops and what goes on in the brain function. This information will build off of the chapters they read in their trauma unit.

**Activity 2.7: Optional Website Exploration | Brain Imaging with Dr. Amen**
The purpose of this activity is to visually see what the brain looks like when it is affected by an addiction. This will provide the students with an image they can apply to their readings. This is an optional activity for students.

**Activity 2.8: Read Chapter 29-33 “In the Realm…”**
The purpose of this activity is to explore what is needed to connect with those struggling with addiction and what we can do as a society to bridge the gap of misunderstanding. Gabor Mate talks about something called Compassionate Inquiry which aids in this process.

**Activity 2.9: Read EFFT Chapters 2-3 & p.153-154**
This activity provides the opportunity to build on our skills of EFFT. These chapters explore emotion coaching and validation which will be the main focus of our class.

**Activity 2.10: Visual of Emotion Coaching**
The purpose of this activity is to provide the students with a visual from Daniel Siegel about what goes on in the brain when emotion coaching can happen which will provide a visual to go with the learning of the skill.

**Activity 2.11: Optional Reflection | Looking Back**
The purpose of this activity is to check in with students on their perceptions of those struggling with addictions. Sometimes there can be an attitude shift and more space for compassion as there is more understanding about the world of addiction. This is an optional activity for students.

**Activity 2.12: Read Chapter 4,” In the Realm…” & Validation Exercise**
The purpose of this activity is to practice our skills of validation using a real example from the text. This activity will focus only on the first part of a validation and not the second part of emotional support and behavioral support.
