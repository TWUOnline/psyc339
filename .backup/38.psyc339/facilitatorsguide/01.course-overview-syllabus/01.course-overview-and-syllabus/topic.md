# Facilitator’s Guide for Psyc 339:  

## Mental Health and Adjustment

This guide will give you an overview of the course, including the syllabus, suggested facilitation strategies for synchronous sessions, and instructor notes. Please also review the course contents in Moodle. All assignments and learning activities for each unit are explained in detail, and this guide is meant to supplement the information found in the Moodle course.
Before you begin, read through the Course Introduction in Moodle, including the course description, learning outcomes, introduction page and assessment overview.
This course does not follow one designated textbook and is a compilation of some of the experts in each of the fields covered in the course. One of the goals of the course is to provide students with the opportunity to become familiar with the major researchers in each of the fields in order to provide them with a foundation and a reference point for when they are practicing in the field later on.

Each unit in the course is separated into the same three topics to help create a sense of connectivity: What the mental health issue is, why it happens/what effects it has on the brain and then how to work with it in the therapy room. There is so much information out there on each topic, but my hope is that they will be provided with enough of a foundation to start to know what to do or where to go for more resources/information.

The same therapeutic approach is used throughout the entire course as well to provide students with the opportunity to try and get more comfortable with a therapeutic approach instead of just learning briefly about a lot of them. Each unit will have the opportunity to practice some of the skills. There are some interventions in this approach that are allowed to be completed by a licensed therapist, so the focus is on the skills we can use. I would recommend becoming very comfortable with the EFFT approach before teaching this course.

### Course format

This course is a blend of asynchronous and synchronous: students work through the course in Moodle according to the course schedule, submitting assignments by assigned due dates. There are optional (but highly recommended), scheduled class sessions in Zoom that students can attend, where the instructor reviews key ideas, answers students’ questions, and facilitates online group activities like discussions.

Ideally, students should review the unit content in Moodle first and then attend the live session to cover knowledge gaps and Q&A. However, this does not always happen; some students prefer to engage in the live lecture first, and then follow-up on their own with the content in Moodle. How the instructor will manage this depends on their own pedagogy; however, if your program has a synchronous session component, use some of that time to summarize each topic and make space for Q&A.  All live sessions should be recorded and posted to Moodle in the appropriate tab.

### Course Navigation

This course is organized into 6 units. Each page of the course will provide students with the following information:

+ A general overview of the topic that will be addressed during the unit.
+ Specific learning outcomes and topics for the unit.
+ Resources that the students need to address learning activities and assessments in the unit.
+ Learning activities that the students need to complete each unit.
+ Assessments pages to provide the student with information about each evaluation artifact that must be completed.
