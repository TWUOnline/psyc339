## Topic 1: What is Depression, Suicidality and Eating Disorders?

Suicidality, eating disorders, and depression are some of the 'main' mental health issues that one might encounter in the therapy room. These issues will only be touched upon in this unit.
In our EFFT text, we have been learning that mental health issues are caused by unprocessed emotions. Rather than going through things that cause mental health issues, it is going through them alone without the ability to process what is happening. According to EFFT, mental health issues would not occur if we were able to process emotions correctly. Both trauma and addiction can be comorbid.

It may seem that the first two topics are disjointed from the previous topics, but the purpose is to pique your interest and introduce you to the researchers and clinicians in this field.
Throughout this unit, I encourage you to draw upon and incorporate what you have learned from the previous units, particularly about the brain and how it interacts with these issues.

#### Depression

The medical term depression (major depressive disorder) refers to a serious, common psychological illness that negatively affects your feelings, your thoughts, and your actions. An individual suffering from depression may experience sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities they previously enjoyed. Depression may also make it difficult for an individual to perform their duties at work or at home. There may be a variety of emotional and physical problems associated with it.

There is a wide range of symptoms associated with depression, ranging from mild to severe. The symptoms include feeling sad or depressed, losing interest in activities that used to be enjoyable, losing weight or gaining weight because of changes in appetite, oversleeping, difficulty sleeping, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty concentrating, thinking, or making decisions, and thoughts of suicide or death.

#### Suicidality

Suicidality includes suicide attempts as well as suicidal ideation. A suicidal ideation is the presence of suicidal thoughts. A person may experience suicidal ideation in a variety of ways, from fleeting and unwelcome thoughts to a preoccupation with death that requires extensive planning.

In this section, you will read older sources, which provide a very good explanation of what suicide is. It is important to note, however, that suicide is no longer referred to as someone committing suicide but rather as someone dying by suicide. Having this distinction is important, as it emphasizes the importance of depression and suicide, and how in those extremely dark moments, it would not be a choice to commit suicide.

#### Eating Disorders

An eating disorder is a behavioral condition characterized by persistent and severe disturbances of eating behaviors, as well as distressing thoughts and emotions. Physical, psychological, and social functioning can all be affected by these conditions. In addition to anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, avoidant restriction of food intake disorder, and pica and rumination disorders, there are several other eating disorders.
