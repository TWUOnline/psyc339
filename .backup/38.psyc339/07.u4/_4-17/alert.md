### Activity 4.17: Practice |  Emotion Coaching/Behavior Coaching

In this section, we will practice our skills of Emotion Coaching and Behavior Coaching. While this may seem repetitive, the more you practice, the easier it will become. The EFFT manual contains suggestions for behavior coaching strategies for depression, as well as what depression requires in terms of emotional support. As an example, consider a scenario in which a parent seeks your assistance with their child who is suffering from depression. You will assist the parent in developing a script that they can use at home with their children.
