## Assessment

After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to start on the class/oral presentation which is an individual assignment as well as to complete your weekly Forum question.

&nbsp;

#### Assignment 1: Class/Oral Presentation (20min)

The students will be divided into groups of five and each group will be assigned one of the topics presented in the units (topics will be assigned by the professor). In the jigsaw method, each student is responsible for watching the presentations of their fellow group members and providing one comment/question for each. Presentations will be 20 minutes long and will require information from 2 research articles and one community resource pertaining to the student’s topic.  All presentations must be pre-recorded and uploaded to Microsoft streams by the end of week 5. The professor will go over how to upload videos to Microsoft streams during Week 2 class. Presentations must be 20 minutes, the professor will only watch a minute past the 20 minute mark.

Each student will then be required to watch their fellow group members' presentations before the start of Week 6 class. Each student will be required to write one comment and one question on each presentation they view (4 presentations) to be handed in before the last day of classes. On the last day of classes there will be time given to answer any clarifying questions related to the presented topics.

#### Assignment 2:Forum Discussion Participation

Questions for this Week:
We have read about clinician blocks in our EFFT manual (go back and refresh yourself if you need to). What do you think your biggest block would be in regards to working with mental health issues? Pick one of the three topics that we have discussed in this unit. What is the block and how would you go about addressing the block for yourself?
Discussions are an important part of this online course. Most discussion postings should be no more than 250 words. You are also asked to read your fellow learner’s postings and then respond to at least two other people.

All postings should be carefully written and edited before being posted. Opinions should be well supported. Your responses should also be communicated in professional language, respectful of others, and to the point. Your assignment will be graded according to the following criteria:
