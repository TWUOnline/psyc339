### Activity 4.11: Video | Suicide and the brain

Dr. Amen is a prominent researcher who studies the brain in relation to mental health problems; we have previously discussed some of his work.

He is not a very empathetic speaker and some do not agree with some of his approaches (for example guilting clients). Nevertheless, he is a solid researcher and it is important to understand his perspective and how he looks at the brain.
