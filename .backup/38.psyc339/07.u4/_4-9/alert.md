### Activity 4.9: Read | “I don’t want to talk about it…” Chapter 4

Terry Real's book provides insight into how and why depression develops. This chapter will focus on the relationship between trauma and depression, which we discussed extensively in our first unit.

As you will see in the following chapter, Terry Real is a very systemic therapist. Notice the emphasis on process rather than content - HOW the client is showing up rather than what the client wishes to discuss or share. Observe how Terry Real's approach relates to our learning of EFFT.
