### Activity 3.10: Review | EFFT Chapters 1-2, READ chapter 5

In this section, we will revisit how EFFT can be applied in our work with grief, loss, and death. EFFT, along with the ability to validate emotions, offers a way to express those unspeakable moments by providing language and bridging the gap between the prefrontal cortex and the limbic system. The goal of this exercise is to learn how to guide emotional experiences even when words are unavailable. The use of EFFT aligns well with the ideas presented in the preceding article, as the author emphasizes that every individual’s grieving process is unique, influenced by various factors. Therefore, effective validation skills will be crucial throughout this journey.

In addition, we will spend some time today discussing death and dying. This is a topic that we tend to avoid discussing- the reasons varying from individual to individual. This is referred to as working through blocks. Today, we will conduct a personal exercise related to this topic.

### Questions to Consider

1. What are three things conditioned responses are based on?
2. Describe what a block is.
3. What is block work?
4. What is the main paralyzing emotion that fuels blocks in caregivers?
5. When is caregiver resentment most likely to surface?
6. Describe what the authors mean by the ‘wisdom’ in the blocks? What does it help us do?
7. What is the tree metaphor?
8. Name some of the self-assessment tools.
9. What is the benefit of ‘speaking into the void?
10. What are some other techniques they list that can regulate emotions in a caregiver?

**Exercise: Block Work**

As we work through a block, we will focus on the psychoeducational component. In spite of the fact that you have read about how you can work with caregivers to work with blocks, I would like you to take the opportunity to apply it to yourself at this time, especially with regard to the subject of death. As we have discussed in this unit, death and loss are topics that tend to be avoided in our culture, but research shows that those who are dying, those who are grieving, need to talk about it. Having stated this before, I would argue that it is for this reason that we do not have the proper systems in place in North America to provide assistance, honor, and support to the elderly. Atul Gwande stated in our reading above that we have come to venerate independence above all else. In order to avoid experiencing pain in those vulnerable places, we avoid going there.

1. When I hear/talk/think about death OR When I interact with/think about the elderly…
2. I feel (emotions-roots):
3. and therefore I react with (pattern-branches)

After you identify the block and validate for yourself why it is present, I encourage you to implement the premise behind the relationship dimensions scale which is to do the exact opposite of what you normally do. For example, if you never talk about death, seek out someone you trust to have that conversation with. If you have someone in your life that is elderly, like a grandparent or a parent and you never ask them about how they are doing with their deteriorating bodies or if they think about the end, maybe open up that conversation. 

**Exercise: Validation of Silence p. 169-170**

We read briefly about the validation of silence in our chapter on caregiver blocks. The exercise is normally performed with a loved one who does not respond to a bid for connection; 'speaking into the void'. I would like you to apply the same format and premise to someone who feels 'blocked' about speaking about death and dying.

Imagine after trying to engage in a discussion/response, you receive no answer/silence. How would you validate them? Their fears? their block to talking about this with you? You can use the guide at the back of the book on pages 169-170 to help you format your response. I encourage you to write it out.

An alternative to writing out a validation of silence for someone else could be for you to write a validation to yourself about your own silence on the subject. You can use the exercise that you did with the tree metaphor to help guide your response.
