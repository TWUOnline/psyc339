# Research Paper

&nbsp;

### Description

Students can choose to expand on the topic that they were assigned for their class presentations and add three more research articles. OR they can pick a new topic and are still required to have 3 research articles. The topic of the paper will answer the question: How would you work with someone who is struggling with ‘your assigned topic’? I invite you to use one of your case conceptualization scenarios as an illustration/case study to incorporate into this paper. The paper will cover **four** main points:

1. An explanation of what the topic is, how and why the topic develops, and how it shows up:
<br>a) You are invited to use one of your case conceptualizations to illustrate your research findings.
<br>b) The majority of the NEW research for your paper should be done in this section. This section should be the largest section in your paper.
2. What are the preventative measures/what wellness looks like in this area:
<br>a) You are invited to use one of your case conceptualizations in this area as a case study/example to draw on as you explore what preventative measures you would use or what wellness would look like. For example, if your character had access to these resources, what may have happened or what would wellness look like for this character?
3. Evidenced based treatment directions/community resources to access:
<br>a) You may use the information from your oral presentations here if it aligns.
<br>b) You are also invited to once again use your case conceptualization here to describe your recommendations/treatment recommendations.
4. What approach to therapy and integration are you drawn to and why
<br>a) You may use your case conceptualization tool here once again to show how you would integrate your faith with this case and/or use some of your thoughts you formed from your Forum discussions.
<br>b) If you are not a Christian, please still include this section and talk about how you would integrate your religion or worldview as we all have one regardless of our backgrounds.

### Sample Thesis

Trauma is a common mental health issue that appears in therapy and as such it is important for clinicians to be trauma-informed and therefore have a foundational knowledge of what trauma is, what the goal of therapy would be (what wellness would look like), and what evidence-based therapy approaches work effectively with trauma. This paper will begin to explore these topics and conclude with a personal reflection on the author’s approach to integration and how it relates to treating trauma.

### Assignment Criteria

For this assignment you will write a 10-12 page paper double spaced. This does not include your title page and reference pages.

Your paper must include a minimum of three high-quality, academic, peer-reviewed sources (e.g., journal articles). You may also use the textbook and other good quality sources in addition, but these do not count as part of the three required sources. Research papers composed entirely of web-based research are not considered suitable as a term paper and will be graded accordingly. Use the APA Publication Manual 7th Edition as guidance for the structure of the paper, citations within the body of the paper, and construction of the reference list.

**As per APA 7 guidelines, papers should:**

Include a separate title page with the title of the paper, your name, student number and date along with the name of our institution (school), the course name and number.
Include a separate list of references that begins on a new page (as per APA style guidelines be double-spaced with 1” margins, typed using a 12 pt. standard font (e.g., Times, Arial or Helvetica) and be left- justified.

Use the same font throughout your paper (do not use different styles or sizes of font for title, headings, etc.). You do not need to write an abstract for this paper.

### Some Writing Tips

1. Follow the APA 7 style guidelines for citing your sources in the text of your paper and formatting on your References page.
2. Use quotes sparingly. For a paper of this length, 4-6 direct quotes is more than enough. Save quotes for when it is absolutely essential to preserve an author’s original wording. The paper should convey your own ‘voice’ as the author.
3. Avoid paraphrasing too much. Paraphrasing can slip easily into plagiarism and also makes for a boring paper. Read this article for tips on avoiding inappropriate paraphrasing.
4. When deciding how much of a study to describe, consider what elements of the study would persuade a reader of your point. For example, in most instances, knowing the number of subjects that were run in the study is not useful information. However, if the study is about a special subset of the population (e.g., AIDS patients), it would be useful to know if the research findings are based on results from 3 people or 30. In most instances, knowing the names of the scales that were administered is irrelevant to your point; even mentioning ALL of the surveys and results is often too much. Pick and choose the relevant aspects of the study design and findings. Don't let your sources dictate how you write your paper. Remember your own logic or outline as you cite sources.
5. Good writers are relentless revisers. Papers that have not been revised are easy to spot: they are unpolished, read like a first-draft and will never receive top marks. You will not receive an A grade without proof-reading your paper. Use spell and grammar check and it never hurts to have someone else read over your paper with a fresh set of eyes before submitting it.
6. Please include citations in your paper. This is a RESEARCH paper and as such you need to a. Demonstrate that you have done the research, b. You are not an expert in this field so you need to back up what you are saying with evidence, c. avoid plagiarism.
7. Do not include references in your reference section that were not cited in your paper. This is called ‘padding your references’ and is not allowed. If there are references in your reference section that are not in your paper I will assume that you are plagiarising.

### Grading Rubric

**Substance /20**
