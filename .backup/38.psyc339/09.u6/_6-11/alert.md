### Activity 6.11: Reflect

Take a moment to write down in paragraph or point form some of your reactions to what you have read. Apply it to your practice.

- When you interact with your clients or in your place of work, do you see psychology and your faith as two separate entities?
- Do you feel comfortable bringing your faith into your work (when it is ethically appropriate)?
- Does your work challenge your faith sometimes?
- Does your faith challenge your work? At work do you place more value on science or on your faith?
