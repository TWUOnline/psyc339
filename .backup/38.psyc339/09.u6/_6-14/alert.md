### Activity 6.14: Read | A Christian Psychology Approach p. 110-113 &129-130

See how a "Christian Psychology Approach" would manifest in the therapy room by reading the pdf provided. It can be challenging to recognize how each of the five approaches would impact the way in which we work, and this is precisely why the book Counselling and Christianity: Five Approaches was written. It is hoped that these concrete examples will help solidify how knowledge is applied in practice.
