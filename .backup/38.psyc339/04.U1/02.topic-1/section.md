## Topic 1: What is Trauma?

![alttext](T1overview.jpg "Rough tree trunk texture")

This first unit will lead you to explore some of the research on trauma. Topic 1, will help you not only to gain a basic understanding of the varying types of trauma and how to define them, but also to identify the main researchers in the field. Learning about the prominent researchers in this field will give you a good foundation and direction to fall back on as you go further in your studies and as you encounter trauma in your day-to-day activities.

The resources provided for this topic will discuss the areas of the brain it affects and how it differs from stress. Van der Kolk's famous 'The Body Keeps the Score' book will also be discussed, and we will conclude this section with some definitions and key terms you should know.

### Trauma

Trauma is a very difficult mental health issue to work with. A trauma is a painful, confusing, intergenerational, illogical, interfering, irrational, and shocking experience. The treatment of trauma requires more than a series of four to five sessions; it can be a lengthy and complex process with advances and setbacks.

A trauma can manifest itself in many different ways; both Dr. Spinazzola and Dr. Bessel Van der Kolk are prominent researchers in the field of trauma. They are known to emphasize that it is not the traumatic incident that remains with people/effects, but rather the unprocessed emotions and having to go through the trauma alone that remain with them. This is also emphasized by LaFrance, the co-creator of Emotionally Focused Therapy.

The culture of our society is so geared towards avoiding pain at any cost that when it does emerge, we attempt to shut it down and conceal it before it causes too much damage. It is in the avoidance of the pain, in the avoidance of the traumatic event, that the darkness and maladaptive coping skills emerge, which are often what bring people into therapy.

In the course of working with trauma as therapists, we have the tendency to desire a quick fix or to avoid entering into the dark pit of pain. It can be difficult to navigate this fine line between going too far and experiencing secondary trauma and avoiding feeling the pain with our clients. As a consequence, we would like to warn you that some of the stories and case studies we will be discussing in this course may be triggering or difficult to listen to. Take note of your ability to engage with the material as the intention is not to create dysregulation within you.
