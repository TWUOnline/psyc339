### Activity 1.9 Optional Reading | Treating Adult Survivors of Childhood Emotional Abuse and Neglect (Pgs.3-12)

Literature in this section discusses emotional abuse/neglect and psychological trauma. Emotional and psychological trauma is a relatively new and complex area of trauma study and it is crucial that we learn how this affects the systems in which we live, work, and commune. As you read this section, keep their working definition of complex trauma in the back of your mind. The authors describe complex trauma as:

1. An escalating and recurrent form of trauma, primarily affecting families or intimate relationships.
2. Survival must take precedence over normal psycho-biological development. “...a dualistic, pernicious, and progressive relationship between exposure and adaptation.” (p.9)

Read pages 3 to 12 of [Hopper, E. K., Grossman, F. K., Spinazzola, J., & Zucker, M. (2021). Treating adult survivors of childhood emotional abuse and neglect: Component-based psychotherapy. The Guilford Press.](Survivors_of_Emotional_Abuse_and_Neglect.pdf)
