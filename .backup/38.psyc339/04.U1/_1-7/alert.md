### Activity 1.7: Reading |  In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts

Gabor Mate's book, In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts, focuses on addiction.  You may want to spend some time reading **Chapters 17 and 18** to better understand how addiction and trauma are intertwined.

Mate is famous for saying, “don’t ask why the addiction, but why the pain.” He would state that every person who has an addiction has experienced trauma. Thus, we will read a few chapters from the book that describe how the brain develops and works. Observe how Gabor Mate describes both physical trauma and emotional trauma. The need for strong attachment figures from a young age has been discussed and will continue to be discussed-this section explains the effects on the brain and brain development. Our next unit on addiction will benefit from investigating the effects on the brain.
